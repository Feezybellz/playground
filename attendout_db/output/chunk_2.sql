You don\'t have anything to say to each other</h4><p>When something comes up in life, whether that\'s a work event or any accomplishment and your partner isn\'t the first person you\'re sharing it with, or&nbsp;one of the first, it means that you prefer to get your needs mets outside the relationship.</p><p>Not having any meaningful conversations aside from rudimentary conversations about chores and things that need to get done is a warning sign that your relationship is not in a good place</p><p><strong>2. The void between you keeps growing wider and wider</strong></p><p>One way to distinguish between a run-of-the-mill marital rut and a loveless marriage is to ask yourself how long the situation has been this way, and whether it\'s been steadily worsening.</p><p>Most couples go through rough times, but if the difficulties last more than two years, with no sign of relief, you probably should seek professional help. And sooner is always better to avoid passing the point of no return.</p><p><strong>3. You dream about a life without your spouse</strong></p><p>If you often imagine a happy future without your partner, that\'s a major sign that things aren\'t right.</p><p>This is a part of the emotional detachment process, during which you may try to convince yourself that you don\'t care anymore so that the eventual separation feels less painful.</p><p>Detaching psychologically by fantasising about having an affair or making plans for the future that don\'t include your partner can all be signs that you\'ve fallen out of love.</p><p><strong>4. You\'re not be listened to (or listening)</strong></p><p>When you sit down to talk with your spouse about what\'s working and what isn\'t, do you hear silence? Or does it feel like nothing changes, no matter how vocal you are about your feelings? That\'s a problem!</p><p>The most powerful tool we have for resolving our conflicts is listening and understanding one another.</p><p>When we invite our partners to share what we\'ve done to let them down, and when we truly listen and understand their feelings, decades of hurt and anger can easily fade away.

You\'re about to have an emotional affair</strong></p><p>If you\'re not happy with your husband, you might be falling into an&nbsp;emotional affair, making another male the priority in your life.

I always feel glad that people open up to me, meantime I feel heavy because this is a problematic scenario.\"</p><p>More than half of suicides around the world are in Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions, <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43929/9789241596893_eng.pdf?sequence=1\">according to the World Health Organization</a>. And although the number of suicides is highest in Japan or South Korea, it is one of the <a href=\"http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/tc/teacher/student-guidance-discipline-services/lecture-notes/lecture-notes-201516/20160422_seminar_2.pdf\">leading causes of death</a> in Hong Kong: about <a href=\"https://csrp.hku.hk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017WSPD_slide.pdf.pdf\">900 per year in the past decade</a>. Hong Kong\'s suicide rate is sixth in Asia, behind South Korea, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, Japan and Taiwan, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120122021659/http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/\">according to WHO.</a></p><p>This figure includes students who take their lives due to academic pressures, but the silent majority are men and seniors who don\'t speak up. The suicide rate of people over 65 is about 40 times more than of those under 15, according to the <a href=\"https://csrp.hku.hk/statistics/\">Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention</a>. And the suicide rate for men is about <a href=\"https://csrp.hku.hk/statistics/\">twice as much</a> as for women</p><p>Men are less willing to talk due to pride, while seniors worry that after retirement, they have no value and are more of a burden to their families, said Clarence Tsang, chief executive of <a href=\"http://help4suicide.com.hk/\">Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong</a>, which provides counseling services to people with suicidal tendencies and behavior. The agency was the first of its kind in Asia.</p><h3>Under-reported in Asia</h3><p>Though one in eight may be the statistic for depression and anxiety in Hong Kong, Reidy said the number is \"probably an under-representation, as stigma and shame prevents many people from reporting (problems with) mental health.\"</p><p>Only a quarter of people experiencing a mental health problem reach out for professional help in Hong Kong, said Reidy, who has worked in the field for over a decade.</p><p>Even so, the<a href=\"http://www.hpdo.gov.hk/doc/e_mhr_full_report.pdf\"> demand for psychiatric services</a> has been increasing about 18% in Hong Kong, from 187,000 in 2011 to over 220,000 in 2016. And the caseload for child and adolescent psychiatric teams has increased by more than half in five years: from 18,900 in 2011 to 28,800 in 2016.</p><p>But health care services aren\'t in a position to meet the growing demand.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180423151045-mental-health-hk-3-exlarge-169.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Reidy is CEO of the new charity Mind HK.\"></figure><p>Hannah Reidy is CEO of the new charity Mind HK.</p><p>\"Resources here are really low,\" Reidy said. \"To add to this problem, the resources that we do have (small nongovernmental organizations and services, as well as larger organizations) are struggling to connect with the population that needs them. This is partly due to the public\'s lack of awareness and partly stigma.\"</p><p>To adequately treat those affected by mental health disorders, the <a href=\"http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/mental_health/psychiatrists_nurses/atlas.html\">WHO</a> recommends a ratio of 10 psychiatrists per 100,000 people. The ratio in <a href=\"http://www.hkcpsych.org.hk/index.php?lang=en\">Hong Kong</a> is about 4.9 psychiatrists per 100,000 people; the UK, where Grant was from, has a ratio of 14.6.</p><p>\"There are under half the number of psychiatrists recommended by the World Health Organization for our population size,\" Reidy said.</p><p>As a result, the level of care is affected. This was the case for Yan, who was only comfortable giving her first name, after a court ordered that she get counseling for early psychosis in 2016. She said that \"powers\" were controlling her, making her do things like talk to herself.</p><p>In cases of early psychosis, early intervention can cut the risk of suicide by half, according to a recent<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2676847\"> study in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a>.</p><p>Without the court order, said Yan, a 39-year-old engineer, she would never have realized that she needed counseling. The lack of doctors in the system was also challenging, she said, because her case managers constantly change, and thus she ends up using most of her consultation time explaining her own diagnosis to the doctor.</p><p>Another challenge to treatment is the cost. When someone does find a doctor, it\'s expensive.</p><h3>Sticker shock</h3><p>In the UK, Grant saw a therapist for free under his work\'s health care and the National Health Service, but in Hong Kong, it was more than HK $3,000 (almost US<strong> </strong>$400) per hour, Parker said.</p><p>The cost was not sustainable, even though he had a well-paying job, she said, so he started to self-medicate, buying sleeping pills at local pharmacies and drinking.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180411174751-reading-tablet-in-bed-stock-medium-plus-169.jpg\" alt=\"Night owls have 10% higher mortality risk, study says\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/12/health/night-owl-mortality-risk-study/index.html\">Night owls have 10% higher mortality risk, study says</a></p><p>There is not the same \"safety net\" in Hong Kong as other places, said Hong Kong clinical psychologist Klaris Leung, who leads many wellness programs for professionals.</p><p>Leung said that most Hong Kong insurance plans don\'t cover sessions -- a marked difference from her time at her clinic in New York\'s Chinatown district, where many patients had immigrated from Hong Kong and their treatment was<strong> </strong>covered by insurance.</p><p>Andrew Welling faced the same problem. His health care covered therapy in his home country of Australia but not in Hong Kong, where he moved at the end of 2012.</p><p>\"It was a ridiculous experience. I could tell the psychologist had no experience with depression,\" said Welling, 34, who paid HK$2,500 (about US $320) per session. \"It\'s really quite hard to find someone to find that I can talk to. It\'s also expensive, and there\'s a stigma attached to it.\"</p><p>He admits that he could have easily gone the way of Grant, adding that despite all the challenges, as with any injury, one must see a doctor and get help.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180423152317-mental-health-hk-4-exlarge-169.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Welling (left) and a friend at last year&amp;#39;s Blue Tie Ball.\"></figure><p>Andrew Welling (left) and a friend at last year\'s Blue Tie Ball.</p><p>\"When we have injuries in our ankles and knees, it\'s all we talk about, but at no point do we talk about health above the neck,\" Welling said. \"We don\'t walk around with a broken leg without seeing a doctor, so why should mental health be any different?\"</p><p>After losing local rugby friends to suicide, Welling created the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HKbluetieball/\">Blue Tie Ball</a>, a charity night to raise money for mental health groups. Last year, it raised HK $650,000, and this year, it plans to raise HK $1 million.</p><h3>Saving face</h3><p>Depression has a stigma all over the world but is particularly strong in Chinese culture.</p><p>\"They think that it\'s something to be ashamed of,\" said Chan, who has practiced psychiatry in Hong Kong for eight years. \"Chinese culture is more collective, so the whole family will feel the shame as well, indicating there is something wrong with the person and something wrong with the family.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, this view has not changed much over that time, said Chan. She conducted a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27909775\">survey across Hong Kong</a> in 2009 and 2014 and found that there was \"no change of public stigma within the Hong Kong Chinese population.\"</p><h3>Moving forward</h3><p>Before Grant died, he was working on a charity called Help Me, because it was \"all he could think when he was feeling at his worst,\" Parker said.</p><p>She is collaborating with Mind HK<strong> </strong>to create a chatbot for those looking for mental health help.

(19, 'How To Become Indispensable At Work This Year', 'GWEN MORAN', 'show', '<p>Virtually every office has one: that employee who is the go-to contact and seems to know everything and everyone. The office canâ€™t run without her. No one wants to think about what would happen if he ever left.</p><p>Being such a critical part of the team has a number of benefits, including a measure of job security. But those indispensable team members donâ€™t get just that way through arbitrary means. If you want to join their ranks, here are seven ways to get there.</p><h2>CHANNEL ELITE ATHLETES</h2><p>Elite athletes are constantly trying to improve their performance. They fine-tune the details that allow them to compete at the highest levelâ€”and that practice holds some valuable lessons for people who are trying to become exceptional at their jobs, says Porter Braswell, cofounder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.jopwell.com/\">Jopwell</a>, a technology platform that helps black, Latino, and Native American students and professionals unlock opportunities for career advancement.</p><p>â€œWhat I mean by that is not the ability to run fast, jump high, and all the other physical attributes that come with being an athlete. But more of the tactical, being a good teammate, communicating well, knowing how to work hard, being disciplined, being able to multitaskâ€”all the things that come with that athletic mind-set. Competing: Thatâ€™s the mind-set one has to be in before I believe they can perform well,â€ Braswell says.</p><h2>DO YOUR OWN REVIEW</h2><p>You may get regular feedback and a performance review from your supervisor, but itâ€™s also important to do your own regular review to ensure youâ€™re on track with your own goals and expectations, says Carolyn Birsky, founder of <a href=\"https://www.compassmaven.com/\">Compass Maven,</a> a Cambridge, Massachusetts, coaching firm. Keep track of your accomplishments, training, feedback, projects, and overall numbers related to your job. We often think weâ€™ll remember all of these things, but itâ€™s easy to forget pieces here and there, she says.</p><p>Then, periodically <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3029117/how-to-make-self-appraisals-less-painful\">and honestly</a> review your progress, set new goals, and look at what itâ€™s going to take to get to your next milestone, she says. These self-checks can help you ensure youâ€™re keeping on track with your own career development and shore up areas that may need improvement. This practice will also keep you ready for the next time youâ€™re up for a promotion.</p><p>â€œOne of the mistakes employees often make is forgetting to hold those all together in some sort of file. That can be some of your best leverage to put your case forward and say, â€˜This is why I think should be promoted. This is what makes me really good at what I do,\'â€ she says.</p><h2>TRACK YOUR METRICS</h2><p>As you set your new goals, look at the metrics that are going to matter and include them as part of your plan, Birsky says. Whether itâ€™s bumping up a sales quota or improving efficiency or cost controls in your business unit by a certain margin, be sure to look for positive measures to which you can contribute and how you can be <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3068537/the-one-page-cheat-sheet-to-your-most-productive-90-days-ever\">most productive in contributing to them</a>. Companies value employees who are focused on finding ways to raise the performance bar.</p><h2>DO AN ALIGNMENT CHECK</h2><p>Itâ€™s also a good idea to ensure that the areas youâ€™re prioritizing in your career and development are consistent with what the company values, says <a href=\"https://wishingwellcoach.com/\">licensed therapist and career coach Jessica Sweet</a>. You may have a sense of whatâ€™s important to the company, but itâ€™s essential to actually be clear that your efforts are moving initiatives forward that the company cares about, she says.</p><p>â€œI would be looking at what the companyâ€™s goals are for 2018, and be looking at how my skills and experience align with those goals, and how I can set myself up on any projects that are going on, to add the most value to those upcoming projects,â€ she says.</p><h2>SPEAK UP</h2><p>When employees are afraid to show that theyâ€™re imperfect or they donâ€™t know something, it gets in the way of their performance, Birsky says. Learning how to effectively communicate with your boss and team, including asking questions and ensuring that you fully understand assignment instructions and ask questions when you donâ€™t is essential to ensuring youâ€™re performing in the best possible way for your company.</p><p>Beyond that, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3067743/how-to-create-your-own-opportunities-at-work\">ask for opportunities to get better</a>. â€œBe vocal to your boss about the fact that you are open to learning. Ask for opportunities to collaborate with another team, or be vocal about your ideas, or you might see a training [you need to get better]. Make your case for it,â€ she says.</p><h2>ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE</h2><p>Ownership is essential to being invaluable, says Andy Chan, founder of Seattle-based career coaching center <a href=\"http://prime-opt.com/\">Prime Opt</a>. Take ownership of your workâ€”whether itâ€™s a project assignment or even a simple spreadsheet. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3030817/how-to-think-like-an-entrepreneur-even-when-youre-not-one\">Think about it in terms of the bigger picture of the company</a> and what its goals are. When you take full responsibility and apply strategic thinking to your work, youâ€™re immediately supporting your supervisor and team in a new and more valuable way. â€œEvery time, when it comes to you learning new skills, it actually opens up a conversation for you to ask for a raise or a promotion,â€ he says. So, think about what you can take ownership of in your work environment, and treat your work as if you own the company and are acting in its best interest.</p><h2>MAKE YOUR BOSS LOOK GREAT</h2><p>One of the most important things you can do to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3067748/four-easy-ways-to-reboot-your-relationship-with-your-boss-this-year\">be indispensable to your boss</a> is to help them excel, Braswell says. People value those who help them do their jobs better.</p><p>â€œReally get in the mind-set of the person youâ€™re working for or alongside and really figure out, â€˜What are they trying to achieve?\'â€ he says. â€œThrough having an understanding of what theyâ€™re trying to achieve and having the context, you can then say to them, â€˜What can I be doing to help you achieve that goal?\'â€ Once you know where you fit in and exactly the metrics on which you should be focused, you can rank or prioritize your efforts on those tasks and initiatives, he says.</p>', 'uploads/1448289new.jpg', 'admin2023731819', '19:34:43', '2018-05-10', '28cr32ihalet0w6o4072', 0, '', 0, 412, NULL),

When Socrates heard that the oracle had made such a comment, he believed that the statement was wrong.</p><blockquote><p>Socrates said: â€œI know one thing: that I know nothing.â€</p></blockquote><p>How can the smartest man on earth know nothing? I heard this paradoxical wisdom for the first time from my school teacher when I was 14 or 15. It made such an impact on me that I used Socratesâ€™s quote as my learning strategy.</p><p>â€œI know nothingâ€ to me, means that you might be an educated person, but still, you know nothing. You can learn from everything and everyone.</p><p>One thing that I like better than learning from my mistakes is to learn from other peopleâ€™s mistakes. Over the years, Iâ€™ve been blessed to have great mentors, teachers, family, friends, that taught me about life.</p><p>What you will find below is a list of the most important things I learned from other people and <a href=\"http://dariusforoux.com/100-great-books-to-read-in-a-lifetime/\">books</a>. Some of the lessons took me a long time to learnâ€”but if I had to learn these things all by myself, it would take me a lot longer.</p><p>We might learn things quickly, but we often forget things at the same rateâ€”and sometimes we need to remind ourselves of the things weâ€™ve learned.</p><p>Here are 25 of those reminders that others taught me.</p><ol><li><strong>Struggle Is Good</strong> Never say â€œI canâ€™t take it anymore.â€ Say â€œBring it on!â€</li><li><strong>Donâ€™t Complain </strong>Complaining is the biggest waste of time there is. Either do something about it, and if you canâ€™t, shut up about it.</li><li><strong>Spend Time With People You Love</strong>Thatâ€™s your family and best friends. If you donâ€™t have a family, create one. Most people in life are only visitors. Family is for life.</li><li><strong>Donâ€™t Start A Relationship If Youâ€™re Not In Love</strong> Iâ€™ve done this more than once. You kind of like someone and think: â€œWe might as well give it a shot.â€ Not a good idea. Youâ€™re either in love, or you are not. Donâ€™t fool yourself. Itâ€™s not fair to you and the other person.</li><li><strong>Exercise Daily</strong> I didnâ€™t get this until recently. A healthy body is where you have to start everything in life. If you canâ€™t build a healthy and strong body, what CAN you build in life?</li><li><strong>Keep A Journal</strong> No, keeping a journal is not for children. It helps you to become a better thinker and writer. â€œI donâ€™t want to be a writerâ€ you might think. Well, how many emails and texts do you send a day? Everybody is a writer.</li><li><strong>Be Grateful</strong> Say â€˜thank youâ€™ to everyone and everything. â€œThank you for this beautiful day.â€ â€œThank you for your email.â€ â€œThank you for being there for me.â€</li><li><strong>Donâ€™t Care About What People Think</strong> We all die in the end, do you really think it matters what people think of you?</li><li><strong>Take More Risks</strong> Donâ€™t be such a wimp.</li><li><strong>Pick An Industry, Not A Job</strong> If you want to become good at something, you need to spend years and years doing that. You canâ€™t do that if you hop from industry to industry. Pick an industry you love and start at the bottom. You will find the perfect role for you eventually.</li><li><strong>Lead The Way</strong> When you find yourself in a situation where everyone looks at each other, itâ€™s time for you to lead. Youâ€˜re a leader when you decide to become one. Thereâ€™s no initiation or a title. Just a decision.</li><li><strong>Money Is Not The Most Important Thing</strong> You have to train yourself not to care about money and focus on providing value instead. Also, donâ€™t become too dependent on the stuff you own â€” otherwise, the stuff will own you.</li><li><strong>Be Nice</strong> I donâ€™t mean you should be a pushover. You can be someone that doesnâ€™t take shit and be nice about it. Just donâ€™t insult people, think youâ€™re better than them, or act like an idiot.</li><li><strong>Learn Every Day</strong> Youâ€™ve got to train your brain to stay alert. You donâ€™t have to read a book a day to learn every day. Learn from your mistakes. Learn from the people around you â€” be open to what they can teach you.</li><li><strong>Rest Before You Are Tired </strong>Even if you love your job, and every day seems like a holiday, you need to take time to rest. Youâ€™re a human and not an android, never forget that.</li><li><strong>Donâ€™t Judge</strong> Just because people make different choices than you, they are not stupid. Also, you donâ€™t know everything about people, so donâ€™t judge them â€” help them.</li><li><strong>Think About Others</strong> Just be mindful, thatâ€™s all. We all have families, bills to pay, and our own issues. Donâ€™t always make everything about yourself.</li><li><strong>Give Without Expecting Something In Return</strong> Donâ€™t keep score. You will become a bitter person if you do that. Give solely for the joy of giving. If you get something in return, great, if you donâ€™t, great.</li><li><strong>Thereâ€™s No End Game</strong> We, as a species, just <i>are</i>. Donâ€™t try to figure it all out. Enjoy your journey.</li><li><strong>Enjoy Small Things</strong> I like clichÃ©s because they are true. Especially this one. You know why? Everyone says they know it, but no one lives up to it. They just chase big things.</li><li><strong>Donâ€™t Take Yourself So Serious</strong> Yeah, yeah, youâ€™re an individual, and people have to take you seriously, I get it. But at the end of the day, weâ€™re all a bunch of ants trying to chase the same things. Lighten up.</li><li><strong>Donâ€™t Blame People</strong> Whatâ€™s the point? Do you want to punish them? You donâ€™t do that to people. Also donâ€™t blame yourself â€” youâ€™re only human.</li><li><strong>Create Something</strong> Not to leave a legacy, you wonâ€™t be here to see it anyway, but to be of use. Make music, write a book, build a table, anything. Youâ€™ll feel good about yourself, plus you give something back to people to use or enjoy.</li><li><strong>Never Look Back Too Long</strong> Reflecting on the past is only good for one thing: Learning.</li><li><strong>Take Action</strong> Donâ€™t just sit there, do something. Without action, there is no outcome.</li></ol><p>You might know a lot. But like Socrates, you and I know nothing at all.

Your goals are typically set as <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/bruce-eckfeldt/the-simple-4-box-model-that-skilled-entrepreneurs-use-to-analyze-important-decisions.html?cid=search\">outcomes</a>, such as \"<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BNmJaf\">lose 50 pounds</a>,\" \"make $100,000 in paid speeches,\" \"save $25,000,\" and the like. And it makes sense because, after all, you care more about <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BNmJaf\">losing 50 pounds</a> than about working out every day. You care more about making $100,000 in paid speeches than about the required marketing activities. You care more about saving $25,000 than about spending less. You care about the goals and the benefits from them, more than about the actions you must perform to reach them.&nbsp;</p><p>There are four reasons why focusing on the goals may prevent you from achieving them.</p><h2>1. Your goals might be unrealistic</h2><p>Can you really make the commitment required to lose 50 pounds? Is it even possible to generate $100,000 in paid speeches given that you have done zero marketing and generated less than $1,000 last year? Are there enough discretionary expenses you can cut that would allow you to save $25,000 next year? The goals could be stretch goals and not necessarily very easy to achieve, but not impossible ones. If the goals are impossible to achieve, chances are that you will not achieve them. Half way through the year (or even earlier) you would realize that and, most likely, abandon them altogether.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. You have no plan how to achieve those goals</h2><p>If there is no specific, realistic, and executable plan to achieve the goals, chances are that you would not achieve them. What do you need to do to lose 50 pounds? What marketing activities must you perform&nbsp;to generate $100,000 in paid speeches? What expenses must you cut to be able to save $25,000 next year?</p><h2>3. Focus on the goals will not get them done</h2><p>If you keep focusing on the goals instead of on the plans to achieve them, you will not be pursuing the right actions. You will instead just see those goals getting harder and harder to reach. You will try different things for a while, abandon them, try new things, and not meet your goals.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. You are not motivated enough (or appropriately) to achieve them</h2><p>If you are not motivate enough to achieve those goals, you might find that the actions required to achieve them are significant enough for you not to pursue them. Losing weight is a great example. I found that the intrinsic value of losing weight was not strong enough to motivate me to exercise and watch what I eat.&nbsp;</p><p>So what should you do?</p><h2>1. Set stretch, yet realistic goals</h2><p>You may want to lose 50 pounds in January, generate $100,000 from paid speeches (even though last year you only generated $1,000), and save $25,000 (even though there aren\'t $25,000 in discretionary expenses you could cut), but those might be unrealistic. Look at your performance last year. Look at other people\'s performance. Set achievable goals, albeit not necessarily such that are too easy to achieve.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Make specific plans</h2><p>Your plans to achieve those goals must be specific, realistic, and executable. Be as detailed as possible. What exactly are the actions you must take, and when must you take them? Make sure that there is a reasonable expectation that if you executed those plans--you will achieve the desired goals. Don\'t simply say \"I\'ll find a way to get there.\" You won\'t.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Focus on the actions, not on the goals</h2><p>Throughout the year, execute your plans exactly as you planned them. Don\'t deviate. Focus on taking the actions you defined in those plans, rather than looking at the goals and wondering if you will ever get there. If your plan was realistic--then executing it exactly as planned will get you to the desired goals.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Create the right motivation</h2><p>You must have enough motivation to take the actions to achieve the goals. Sometimes, the intrinsic motivation for achieving the goals is not enough to take the actions required to achieve them. I found that the intrinsic motivation to lose weight (the value of being healthy and looking good) was not enough for me to work out and eat less as much as I needed to achieve my weight loss target. So I complimented it with extrinsic motivation (\"carrot and stick\") and it worked! (You can read more about that in my book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BNmJaf\"><i>Worst Diet Ever</i></a>).</p><h2>5. Revisit your assumptions</h2><p>Don\'t change the goals because you aren\'t willing to take the actions included in your plan. The only reason to change the goals or the plans is if you realize that the plan will not achieve the desired goal. If that happens, you will have the opportunity to either change the goal or change the plan. You may need to relax the goal, or tighten the plan. Keep asking yourself if there is any reason why the plan might not achieve the goal.

(23, 'OPEN LETTER TO EKITI PEOPLE: THE SELECTION EDUCATION AND THE FUTURE OF EKITI DEVELOPMENT â€“ PART I', 'Folorunso T. Obasuyi', 'show', '<p><i><strong>Dear Ekiti Sons and Daughters,</strong></i></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>I hope this piece of message, in the form of an open letter meets you in excellent condition.</p><p>This letter or article is about <i><strong>selection education</strong></i> regarding the process of choosing a right candidate during elections, with particular interest to Ekiti State, Nigeria. We observed that the previous writers about Nigeria leaders versus economic development have not delved deeply into the <i><strong>selection education</strong></i>, in other words, <i><strong>selection principle</strong></i> for right candidacy, but identified some frailties of current and previous governments (Kehinde, 2018, Kolawole, 2018). Though the previous writers pointed to the weaknesses and affirmed that â€œif leadership fails, citizens must not fail and there lies the beauty and importance of democracyâ€ (Obasanjo, 2018 as quoted in Kehinde 2018, last paragraph), the ideas developed in their writings fail to give actual direction to the people for the choice of right candidate. Even the coalition party advocated for requires a proper guide to select a right person for development sake. So, this letter or article, firstly, identifies the practical weaknesses of governance in development paradigm as applicable to Sub-Sahara Africa, Nigeria and in particular, Ekiti State. Secondly, it presents a selection principle as a guide for the electorate rational selection of political aspirant in the coming Ekiti election with extension to nationwide elections. In so doing, we crave your indulgence and patience to read, download and keep the letter for future reference.</p><p>Permit me to digress a little to clarify my interest and personality. Firstly, I am very unpopular, but I always have the interest of Ekiti people and its development at heart. Currently, I Live outside the country as a Student. I suppose to remain calm, but my recent experience and knowledge of development do not permit the absolute silence because development is a burning fire that controls and satisfies human needs. On the one hand, I would have kept quiet because of my status as a secular worker. On the other hand, the inspired book says that my people are dying because they lacked knowledge. I am further motivated to write the article because of the impact of the recent World Bank seminar I attended in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where the issue of market failures that lead to government failures was thoroughly discussed with the support of empirical findings. The guest speaker suggested information dissemination to the people as a reliable weapon to resuscitate market and government from further failings.</p><p>Being that said, I want to make it clear that I am not a politician neither am I in any political party. I am just a potential electorate, advocate and preacher of development due to my current experience in Development Studies. In a similar vein, I am not campaigning for any political aspirants to assume the office of the Governor. In other words, consider me as a neutral person as per politics of the State. Instead, find the writer of the letter as a person who wants the good of the State.</p><p>Back to the issue. The writing inspiration arose from two scenarios. Firstly, there is a crawling development in Nigeria that spill over to Ekiti State. Realizing that Malaysia and Nigeria almost started the same time in politics and development, the speed of development in Malaysia outlived Nigeria development that makes souls depressed. The lagging behind raises a question â€“ why is Nigeria development resides at the back door of sustainable development? Secondly, making people aware of how to prepare the incoming Governor of the State for development activities, somewhat demands a cursory look at <i><strong>Selection Education</strong></i> which is the keywords of this letter</p><p>My dear people, I want to make it clear that all the aspirants vying for the position of the governorship in the State are good as well as possess characteristics of evil. This reminds us of our imperfection from the origin of creation. Each aspirant past and present behaviour contains suitable and unsuitable for acceptance and rejection to take place. As such, the principle of selection should be set-up for people guidance to make the right choice from the numerous emerged aspirants that have both characteristics of good and evil; suitable and unsuitable. Also, remember that all aspirants are desperate. The letter is organized into two parts (Part I and Part II) because it is a â€œso long a letterâ€.</p><p><strong>Governance Weaknesses</strong></p><p>Before setting the selection principles, let us identify some weaknesses of leadership that permeate Sub-Saharan African countries, with particular interest to Nigeria.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Underrating Power of Research and Development (R&amp;D) -</strong> Both Federal and State Governments are guilty of sustainable research and development (R&amp;D) in Nigeria. Professors are expected to be known and prominent in the society by their research activities towards economic development and improvement of welfare. However, governments have confined the Professors and Lecturers in tertiary institutions into teaching theories and administrative capabilities. But why so concluded? A Professor in an efficient economy represents the <i><strong>seers, prophets and preachers</strong></i> of development either in science, education, social, arts, technology and others. When the duty of PhDs, Associate Professors and full Professors is limited to teaching theory and administrative capacities, it is then you will know that the society is hopeless as we have in Nigeria. Over the years, knowledge is static instead of dynamic. It will be dynamic if R&amp;D is 100 percent taken into consideration. The 100% is attributable to the identification of societyâ€™s problems, find solutions, state policy implications and governmentâ€™s readiness to use the outcome. This aspect is a missing gap in the Nigeria governance system as well as Ekiti State.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The Missing Knowledge of Development</strong>. Poor understanding of what development represents and the knowledge required to set up development tools are missing gaps in most Sub-Saharan African administration particularly Nigeria and Ekiti State. Accessibility into government is excellent and rewarding to the occupier but a general knowledge of development to manage people and the available resources are deficient. For example, if a representative of government (Read Independent Newspaper February 1, 2018,) is saying that electricity does not contribute to the growth of the economy, how will the government perform efficiently and improve the life of the people without an efficient power supply? Is that not suicidal? Can the US switch off electricity for one day or month without effect on the US and world economy?</p><p><i>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><strong>Social Inclusion and Exclusion</strong> -&nbsp; Seeing government as personal property where the society is excluded in the planning and implementation of policies is an issue in the development process of Nigeria and Ekiti State. Inclusiveness is understood as â€œ<i>a process by which efforts are made to ensure equal opportunities for all, regardless of their background, so that <strong>they can achieve their full potential in life.</strong> It is a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating conditions which enable full and active participation of <strong>every member of the society in all aspects of life, including civic, social, economic, and political activities, as well as participation in decision-making processes.â€</strong></i><strong> </strong>(DESA, 2009, P.3). The President of any country or Governor of any State should not claim he/she knows all things without adequate consultation to the house of knowledge. The Holy writing points to the fact that Ancient Kings or Leaders consult with the Seers and Prophets of their time to carry out appropriate actions. They never ignored the prophets and the Seers like we have in Nigeria and Ekiti State. The modern Seers and Prophets regarding knowledge reside in the educational institutions such as Federal, Ekiti State government and private tertiary institutions (i.e. EKSU, College of Education, Health Technology, Federal Polytechnic, ABUAD and FUOYE). Avoidance of knowledge is avoidance of development.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Lack of Definition of NEEDS and WANTS</strong> â€“ Sometimes government is confused about the two concepts, wants and needs. Economically, wants is different from needs. Wants are numerous and insatiable, but NEEDS are the selected items from WANTS, in other words, WANTS are DESIRES.&nbsp; If I should ask the readers about the Statesâ€™ NEEDS, it is not unlikely that WANTS would be at most listed. Whereas, it is easier to budget on the NEEDS than WANTS. On the one hand, people, in general, donâ€™t know or canâ€™t define what they need and channel them to the appropriate arms of the government. No doubt politicians came to them and brainwashed them only to tell them all the WANTS of this planet earth instead of NEEDS of the people. All the WANTS later turn to political lies. At the end of the tenure, none of the WANTS is achievable. On the other hand, experience showed that there is always a <i><strong>misplacement of priority</strong></i> by the government (Federal and State). When people need food, but food money is diverted to build houses or construct roads, what then is the consequence? This raises a pertinent question for welfare consideration. Who will live in the developed houses or drive cars on the constructed roads when all the hungry people of the society had died or admitted in the hospital suffering from related hunger diseases? That is an example of misplacement of priority due to the poor efficiency of the State allocation of economic resources.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Lack of Interest</strong> â€“ INTEREST invites PERSEVERANCE. Hence, not all people vying for leadership in Africa have <i>interest</i> in development. In fact, I presume to have 90% of African leaders have reduced interest in developing their country. Whereas, development is not too difficult to come by, if and only if, INTEREST is fully demonstrated because perseverance would make the target activity come to reality. The parameters for developing a society or country are on the pages of textbooks, journal articles and internets. Also, the World Development Indicators (WEI) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) togetherness with the current Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have development indicators to transform any economy. Full <i><strong>interest in development</strong></i> to put development parameters in place is required in any developing economies like Nigeria, with particular reference to Ekiti State. On the contrary, we are poorly developed because the people in government LACK INTEREST in developing the economy through deficient behaviour in using the appropriate economic indicators. Over the years, they put on <i><strong>pretence face</strong></i> to deceive people. Development depends on the <i><strong>Interest of the President and State Governors</strong></i>, togetherness with their teams.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Political Party Defence</strong> â€“ All the forces in Nigeria and most developing countries of Sub-Sahara Africansâ€™ political arena are in defence of their political party instead of the society and national economic goals. That is not to say that political parties should not have their programmes as strategies of campaigning, but caution need be taken not to replace the general goal with political party programmes. It is suicidal in development journey. For example, is the sitting President/Governor a President/Governor of the people or President/Governor of his/her political party? This is a paradoxical and confusing scenario in development paradigm. For instance, distribution is predominantly a problem of the government but politically influenced because of political party demands with lopsided political party programmes. Specifically, when official portfolios are to be distributed, the distribution had been used to favour political party members whose area of knowledge acquired in the knowledge institutions is far from the office requirements (Kolawole, 2018). Do you expect such a person to perform miraculously with the near-zero scenario? Do you think that development would take place in such a near-zero knowledge environment? Rhetorically, should a sitting President/Governor look for experts if he has interest and passion for development? Should the political party programme outlive the general goal and interest of State development? In my opinion, the political party programme is nonsensical if it does not change the society for better, which should call people attention to rethink their fortune where their fortune is in their hands. Otherwise, poverty and other insecurities (life and social) would remain stable in the Nigeria and Ekiti State social environments.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Corruption </strong>â€“ Corruption is an issue in the national development process. A lot of money went into a private purse, kept inside the water tank, graveyard and the like, only to acquire wealth. In a simple analysis, stealing is socially and colourfully defined as corruption. In other words, a corrupt person is a thieve. Hence, a thieve need not be shielded but need be prosecuted irrespective of the status as applicable in the developed countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Selection Principle</strong></p><p>Based on the preceding arguments, the selection principles to follow in the process of casting of one-man-one-vote for a new person to mantle the leadership of Ekiti State Governorship seat are stated in section A and B.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Section A: Major Selection Principle</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Love and Honesty</strong> - Be honest with yourself and your family (the immediate and extended families) before you support any aspirant at the election. Remember that your fortune and happiness are connected with the one vote you have. Likewise, be aware that if an emotionally stable person becomes a king, the people and families are happy because they will not be excluded from the sharing of economic and social benefits of governance. On the other hand, if bad person becomes the king, people and families live in economic and social agony such as an increase in poverty and social vices. As earlier said, all aspirants are <i><strong>desperate</strong></i> to extort or steal your brain, in other words, your mental thinking, with their machinations, use you during the election, dump you like refuse after the election and later rob you of your fortune, joy and future. Never, I said never should you be guided by stupidity such that the absurdity becomes a stimulant to cause poverty upon yourself and family after the election. The principle is: <strong>BE HONEST AND LOVE YOURSELF, FAMILY AND FUTURE THAN POLITICIAN MACHINATIONS</strong>. This principle anchored others.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Avoid gratification from ANY Aspirants</strong>. Be honest to your selection of aspirant. The N500 or N1000 being distributed at the polling booth is just beggars, poverty acceptance and ritual money to rob you of your fortune, family, society and economic happiness. It is cursed money. Avoid taking it. The consequence is bad.</p><p><i>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><strong>Avoid political promises but search in the context of concrete pledges</strong> - The political pledges include â€œ<i>I will construct roads, I will build hospitals, I will provide employment for all. In fact, I will make education free. There will be electricity 24/7 of the week. Likewise, water will flow in your houses, I will prosecute and jail all corrupt people and many more.â€</i> These are loose and empty promises that had never been achieved by the government of Africa particularly Nigeria after the election. Why? The politicians know that people lack knowledge of what they need from their numerous wants. Also, currently, observation shows that brainwashing the people is easy because almost 95% of the population is poor (either relative or absolute) and inability to make a right choice due to the N500, 1000, 2000, 5,000 bribes for voting, thereby erode the benefits of governance after the election. <i>What then are the concrete pledges expected?</i> I implore you to read section B.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Part I of this letter covers the weaknesses of governance and section A of the selection principle. Read the Part II regarding the remote principles that electorate should consider while attempting to vote any candidate to an office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Folorunso Obasuyi T.

(24, 'She says a pilot raped her, and now she\'s afraid of running into him at an airport', 'Emanuella Grinberg and Christina Zdanowicz', 'show', '<p>Every time Mary Morgan enters an airport, she\'s on the defensive, trying to avoid the man she says raped her.</p><p>She\'s been a flight attendant for SkyWest Airlines for 14 years; he is a pilot for the airline, and someone she used to call a friend. She loves her job, she said, but for the past year and a half since the alleged incident, she\'s been filled with constant dread.</p><p>She has diligently dodged seeing him, she said -- though she\'s had a few close calls. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, her home base, she rushes to the flight board to make sure he isn\'t assigned near her. She knows the types of trips he bids and she avoids flights that use the type of aircraft he flies. If he is assigned nearby, she tries to hide in the airport and avoid common areas, such as crew lounges, until she thinks he\'s gone.</p><p>\"It\'s exhausting, it\'s time consuming and it\'s just demoralizing at the same time because you think \'I have to do all of this and my company is doing nothing to help me,\'\" the 39-year-old told CNN.</p><p>Morgan said her case is indicative of a larger problem in the commercial travel industry, one in which sexual harassment from passengers and co-workers is treated as an occupational hazard. She is suing SkyWest, alleging the company is liable for the actions of Capt. Robert L. Rowe, the pilot who she says raped her during a November 2016 stopover.</p><p>Rowe did not respond to repeated requests for comment and CNN was unable to identify legal representation for him. Morgan filed a police report, but prosecutors dropped the case, citing insufficient evidence.</p><p>\"This is an industrywide issue,\" Morgan said. \"It\'s not just pilots that are rude to flight attendants, it\'s passengers as well that we deal with constantly, that are making inappropriate comments to flight attendants or touching us inappropriately.</p><p>\"You just kind of accept it because it comes with the job, but that\'s still not an appropriate thing.\"</p><p>SkyWest declined to comment on Morgan\'s allegations or provide CNN with a copy of its sexual harassment policy, citing a policy against discussing personnel matters or pending litigation.</p><p>\"The safety of all SkyWest employees is our first priority. We hold all employees to the highest standards of conduct and have a zero-tolerance policy for assault or harassment in the workplace,\" the airline said in a statement to CNN. \"We take all allegations very seriously.\"</p><p>Morgan said she is suing because she wants to end the cycle of mistreatment of women working in the airline industry -- and she\'s not alone. Morgan\'s lawsuit, filed April 25, came one month after Alaska Airlines First Officer Betty Pina sued the airline over how it responded to her June 2017 report of sexual assault by a male colleague during a stopover.</p><p>The women are represented by the same Seattle-based law firm, and their claims are similar: On a layover, after drinks with colleagues, they believe their superiors drugged and raped them. Both lawsuits allege that, given the accused pilots\' positions of authority on the flight and within the company, the airlines are liable for their actions.</p><p>The lawsuits make the airline industry the latest to get swept up in the #MeToo movement to curb sexual violence. The women did not sue the pilots, and the men are not named in any other lawsuit related to the allegations. But each complaint charges that their \"grossly abusive actions epitomize the necessity and purpose of the #MeToo movement.\"</p><p>Lawyers for Capt. Paul Engelien, the pilot accused by Pina, deny he raped her and say she and her attorneys are using support for #MeToo to circumvent his due process rights -- allegations that echo broader critiques of the movement. Pina did not file a police report, choosing instead to go through her chain of command at the airline.</p><p>\"The #MeToo movement is long overdue,\" Sheri Pewitt, co-counsel for Engelien, said in an email to CNN. \"It is a sensitive matter that evokes strong emotions; it should and it must evoke those emotions. Even so, an accusation does not equal guilt and we must not lose sight of due process along the way. Our democracy and the foundation for a functioning justice system depend upon it.\"</p><p>The industry was built on the objectification of women to sell tickets, said Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants. Sexist attitudes persist despite the industry\'s efforts to change its image.</p><p>A new survey by the group found that <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/10/news/airline-attendant-sexual-harassment-survey/index.html\">68% of flight attendants have been sexually harassed</a> by passengers at least once in their careers. When asked about the prevalence of harassment among airline employees, Garland said in an email that \"we don\'t necessarily know\" that it\'s more widespread than in other industries.</p><p>Garland pointed out that, as part of its survey, the group called on industry leaders to send a clear message to the public that harassment of any airline employee will not be tolerated -- a message that should apply to employees, too, she said.</p><p>\"Having that message come from the top leader at an airline signals to every single employee -- whether it be a fight attendant, a pilot, gate agent -- that they\'re going to take these reports and issues seriously.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for Airlines for America, an industry trade association, said it could not speak on behalf of airlines. It offered the following statement:</p><p>\"Our members take these matters seriously and do not tolerate harassment or discrimination in any form as the safety and well-being of all our passengers and crew remains our highest priority.\"</p><h3>\'I needed help\'</h3><p>Before the alleged incident, Morgan told CNN she thought of Rowe as a friend. They had spent time together outside of work, and when he invited her to a hockey game during a layover in Edmonton, Alberta, Morgan was delighted.&nbsp;</p><p>They grabbed a drink after the game, she said in her lawsuit. Morgan told him she was tired, but Rowe, who is about 15 years her senior, asked her to stay for one more. After she returned from the bathroom, she said, another drink was waiting for her, and she consumed it.</p><p>That was her last clear memory of that night, she said in the lawsuit. She felt as if she was in a fog but not intoxicated. She said she does not remember how she returned to the hotel or how she ended up in Rowe\'s room.</p><p>She woke up the next morning in his bed, naked and with bruises on her body, she said in the lawsuit. She knew she had been raped, she said.</p><p>When she returned home to Victoria, British Columbia, where she lives with her parents and cares for her sick mother, she needed to say something, she told CNN in an interview. Weeping and still in shock, she said, she recounted the story to them.</p><p>Within a week, she said she reported the incident to her head flight attendant, someone she had been friends with for years. When they spoke on the phone, she said he dismissed her complaint. She said she was hurt by his indifference.</p><p>She also reported the incident to her supervisor and police in Edmonton. Spokesman Scott Pattison confirmed that police investigated the case and forwarded it to the local Crown Attorney\'s Office, which prosecutes criminal cases.</p><p>\"We confirm that the case was forwarded to prosecutors, but the Crown did not proceed because of insufficient evidence. The case is now closed,\" Pattison said.</p><p>He declined to comment on Morgan\'s lawsuit, citing department policy.&nbsp;</p><p>When Morgan returned to work, she hoped SkyWest would investigate her claims or help her avoid Rowe. She said it took nearly a year for them to conduct a full investigation, and only after she spoke to the company\'s CEO and filed a formal grievance. In the meantime, she said her request for access to Rowe\'s schedule was denied.</p><p>\"I\'m going to work and I\'m scared,\" Morgan said of that time. \"I\'m getting sick, I\'m nervous, I\'m terrified and I just need some help.\"</p><p>She was given three options, she said: Ask to not work with him through a formal \"bid avoidance\" process, take a leave of absence, or transfer to a new base.</p><p>She refuses to transfer or leave a job she loves and takes prides in.</p><p>\"I know I\'m not performing heart surgery up there and I\'m not doing calculus, but I do serve a purpose up there and that\'s to make people feel safe and comfortable.\"</p><p>She doesn\'t need to \"bid avoid\" now because she can choose trips on different aircraft than he flies, based partly on her seniority. But if he transitions to the type of plane she flies, it will be her responsibility to explore that option.</p><p>Transferring isn\'t an option either, she said, because she wants to stay close to her family, especially her sick mother. If she left the company, she\'d lose the seniority she\'s worked so hard for.</p><p>\"That whole me adjusting my life, they shouldn\'t be putting that on me. It should have been up to them to say, \'OK, well this obviously is something we need to look at and make sure they never see each other ever,\'\" Morgan said.</p><p>In an email dated October 18 that she shared with CNN, she pleaded with the vice president and director of inflight operations and the chief operation officer:</p><p>\"I am writing to get some help or ideas on how I can feel safe at work,\" she wrote. \"Because I haven\'t felt safe for the last almost 11 months. You know that I love my job and this last year has been awful trying to cope with the aftermath of being raped.\"</p><p>\"If you have any ideas or suggestions I would really love to hear them. Because I am diminished thinking that my company doesn\'t care about me or feeling safe at work.\"</p><p>The same month, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/20/health/weinstein-metoo-moments/index.html\">CNN asked readers to share their stories of workplace sexual harassment</a>. Morgan responded and agreed to speak only if she could do so anonymously. At the time, she said she did not want to embarrass her company, and she was hopeful it would do the right thing.</p><p>In addition to gender discrimination, her lawsuit accuses SkyWest of retaliating against her by giving her written reprimands for missing work -- absences she attributes to her anxiety over seeing him. After sleepless nights of panic attacks and nightmares, Morgan said she called in sick on the days she didn\'t feel fit for duty.</p><p>\"All along this whole process I needed help,\" she said. \"I couldn\'t give my own statement to the police. I needed my constable to do that. I couldn\'t do my own investigation. I needed my detective to do that for me. I couldn\'t go through therapy on my own, I needed my doctors and therapists for that.</p><p>\"And I can\'t fight SkyWest anymore without legal help. I\'ve tried. I tried for almost a year and a half to do that on my own, but no one\'s listening to me.\"</p><h3>\'You were coming onto me pretty hard\'</h3><p>Like Morgan, Pina said she takes tremendous pride in being a pilot and feels a deep sense of loyalty to her company. Part of it comes from her background as a military pilot who flew helicopter missions in Afghanistan.</p><p>So when, she said, a pilot raped her in June 2017 during an overnight stay in Minneapolis, her first instinct was to report it through her chain of command and not police. For months, she kept it to herself. Months later, she said she came to regret it when her supervisor asked why she did not press charges.</p><p>\"I was so sick to my stomach, I was just realizing telling Alaska was not enough,\" she said in an email to CNN. \"I thought telling my company and the investigation is all I needed to do.\"</p><p>According to her lawsuit, which includes excerpts from an internal investigative summary, pilot Engelien invited her for pizza in a hotel concierge room. When she arrived, just peanuts and vegetables were available.</p><p>She remembers her first glass of white wine, according to the lawsuit. After her second, she started having a hard time keeping her head up and \"things appeared to be closing in.\" At some point afterward, \"Mr. Engelien proceeded to drug and rape Ms. Pina during a state of involuntary intoxication,\" the lawsuit states.</p><p>When she asked him the next day what happened, he denied sexual contact and claimed, \"You were coming onto me pretty hard,\" according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Engelien has been on leave since June 2017, an Alaska Airlines spokeswoman said. Pina, too, was on paid leave from June 6 to January 15 while the incident was under investigation, she told CNN. She is now flying again; Engelien is not.</p><p>Alaska Airlines declined to comment on the lawsuit or respond to specific allegations from Pina about its handling of her report or the investigation, citing a policy against commenting on personnel issues.</p><p>During her time off, Pina said she did not share her account with friends or family, under Alaska\'s orders. She waited at home for a call from her employer. \"I had no understanding of why I wasn\'t flying. They took my statement and I received no feedback,\" she said. \"I felt trapped, unaware of what was going on, and discarded.\"</p><p>Since going public with her claims in March, she said she\'s received notes from flight attendants thanking her for speaking up, some of which include similar accounts of abuse. But she described the response to her investigation from administrative and management teams as \"detached.\" Some leadership members tried to \"bully\" her into not flying, and some captains have dropped trips with her, she said.</p><p>\"The way my airline has handled this is perhaps why abusers feel they are protected,\" she said. \"I hope to protect other woman and men in the industry from abusers like mine. I hope the process streamlines and [is] taken more seriously.</p><p>Through counsel, Engelien continues to deny drugging or raping Pina. His lawyer said that he took a polygraph -- not admissible in American courts of law -- to clear his name and passed.</p><p>The lawyer accused Pina of trying to \"pivot attention away from her own job-ending misconduct,\" including drinking within the prohibited time frame before her next flight. Pina\'s lawyer said an investigation cleared her of wrongdoing related to drinking. Alaska would not confirm, citing policy against disclosing personnel matters.</p><p>\"Pina\'s conduct is both reprehensible and opportunistic as she appears to be using the #MeToo movement as a means to save her career and is ruining an innocent person\'s life in the process,\" Pewitt said.</p><p>\"Captain Engelien and his family have been devastated by Pina\'s false allegations. Captain Engelien is currently evaluating legal remedies available to him including, but not limited to, initiating a defamation lawsuit.\"</p><p>When asked to comment on the lawsuit, Alaska Airlines referred CNN to an <a href=\"https://blog.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/people/respect/\">April 2 blog post</a> in which CEO Brad Tilden affirmed the airline\'s commitment to addressing sexual misconduct on flights and promoting a culture of respect.</p><p>The airline launched new sexual assault training for flight attendants and is developing training for all employees, he said. The company plans to host conversations about preventing and addressing assault and to develop onboard resources for guests and crews.</p><p>\"To be clear, sexual harassment and assault have absolutely no place in our workplace, on board our flights, or any place.\"</p><h3>\'I don\'t want this to happen to anyone else\'</h3><p>Morgan is still doing her job, but she\'s working less than the 120 hours per month she used to fly -- the maximum allowable amount. Now she\'s cut her flying time in half, to about 60 or 70 hours a month.</p><p>\"A lot of it is me mentally not being able to leave my house. And a lot of that is just me trying to deal with the assault,\" she said.</p><p>A friend who doesn\'t work in the airline industry has witnessed the toll this has taken on her friend.</p><p>Nicole Smith wonders if her friend of eight years will ever be able to date again or find a partner. The happy, high-energy friend she knows is mostly still there, Smith said. But \"extreme anxiety\" creeps in when she\'s talking about work -- it\'s all about avoiding Rowe, she said. Smith said Morgan recounted to her the time she panicked when she realized her plane pulled into the Seattle airport next to his.</p><p>\"She doesn\'t want to see the man who raped her. It\'s up to her to make that happen and that causes her so much stress,\" she said. \"You\'ll just see her visibly shake.\"</p><p>Morgan said she had a difficult time going public with her story and having her name in the lawsuit. But she did it to prevent other women from experiencing the same thing.</p><p>\"I\'ve always been someone with a voice. I\'m not a shy person. I\'m not someone who doesn\'t speak their mind. I\'ve always stood up for what I believe in,\" Morgan said.</p><p>\"I\'ve never really been taken advantage of because I always stand my ground. This was someone who took advantage of me and it was wrong. I don\'t want this to happen to anyone else.\"</p>', 'uploads/6789700S093761873-860x484[1].jpg', 'admin2023731819', '08:42:00', '2018-05-15', '69t6674l6h4ai1ecr4es', 0, '', 0, 372, NULL),
(26, 'The 3 Things New Landlords Need to Manage', 'Marcus Maloney', 'show', '<p>Acquiring rental property for passive income is a great way to long term wealth, but there is more work required than it appears on the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aspiring landlords are misinformed about how much work is required to build a successful stream of passive income. It&rsquo;s more than hiring the right property management company, and making the right acquisitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent conversation with an aspiring landlord I was reminded of how misleading mainstream media portray the ins and outs of real estate investing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conversation started by discussing the returns that can be made a month from a small rental portfolio. I began to introduce some of the numbers and concepts such as cash on cash return, NOI, vacancy rates, and cap rate to name a few. All of which he had limited knowledge on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest misconception that was presented is as long as you have a good property management company then you will have minimal problems. I provided him with some information and resources such as Bigger Pockets to learn from. I figured if he was misinformed about the management of rental property then there are others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click Here For Your Free Guide to Renting Your House</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are 3 Things New Landlord Need to Manage:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are the 3 reasons new investors need to manage their own properties. It teaches you so much valuable information that you really shouldn&rsquo;t miss the opportunity!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Financial Responsibilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the financial responsibilities of a rental property is extremely important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is great to have an accountant on your team but in the beginning this may not be feasible. I suggest becoming familiar with monthly financial reconciliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have an advanced degree in finance, but by using quick-books anyone can set up an account and reconcile the monthly income and expenditures for each rental property. Any investment should go through rigorous financial analysis prior to the acquisition but afterwards, monthly report reconciliation will present a clear picture of how the unit is actually performing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related: How to Automate Your Real Estate Bookkeeping</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Trade/Repair Management</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade management is equally important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some investors leave this duty to the property management company, but it is great to have your own resources in the event the property management company may be limited in a certain area. If you have a great property manager you will not have to be as concerned or may not utilize your resources as much but its good to have trades in your tool chest when needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to have an independent plumber, electrician, or carpenter on hand. Not to criticize property managers, but in this profession it is always good to have a back up trades. The reason for this is because you may have relationships where you can be billed for services performed after hours or paying invoices at net 30 or 60 versus immediately, this is depending upon your liquidity of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Tenant Screening/Rapport Building</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tenant rapport building is great when you are starting out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, this is for a smaller portfolio of units or maybe 1 unit. Learning the tendencies of tenants will teach a new landlord what makes a good tenant and what are some characteristics of a terrible tenant. By understanding these tendencies will assist you in ensuring you have the right tenant in your property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related: Tenant Screening: The Ultimate Guide</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a great property manager is critical to expand your business when you are ready, but when starting out these 3 things are best learned through hands-on experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not leave these 3 simple but important pieces to a property manager when starting out as a landlord.&nbsp; I would recommend managing your own property for a couple of years to learn the nuances of being a landlord before hiring a property manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know of any other areas a new landlord should manage in the beginning please share your thoughts!</p>', 'uploads/2737112The-3-Things-New-Landlords-Need-to-Manage-650x336_(1).jpg', 'admin7115698293', '16:57:30', '2018-05-17', '8t73tle8eh9r51a33ic', 0, '', 0, 347, NULL);

She knew the news would get to Adedibu one way or the other and she didn&rsquo;t want him to hear from any stranger. It was already the talk of the town&rsquo;s jesters. His wife, the&nbsp;<em>Olori</em>&nbsp;had been caught in bed with Rotimi, the&nbsp;<em>Balogun</em>&nbsp;and her ex-lover. It was true the king had taken the proverbial meal from the pauper&rsquo;s mouth even though he had an overflowing storehouse of food by asking the hand of Kikelomo in marriage when everyone in town knew Rotimi and her had been together since their childhood days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adedibu was known as one who did whatsoever he pleased caring less about what others thought but Adesewa knew that Kikelomo was the only thing he had ever wanted that felt out of his grasp and that he was not as inhumane as the villagers thought him to be. Rotimi had stood no chance with Kikelomo when Adedibu asked her hand in marriage because he was the&nbsp;<em>Kabiyesi</em>&nbsp;and no one dared question his choice, not even the Balogun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now, the shaky promise of peace that the villagers had held on to when Rotimi had not challenged Adedibu about taking Kikelomo from him was shattered. All hell was let loose. The sound of wailing she heard from the palace had her hurrying her steps. The noise seemed to be coming from the Queen mother&rsquo;s hut and she just knew that she was too late. The news had already gotten to the palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she got closer to the King&rsquo;s hut, she passed by people with solemn faces. Ahead of her,&nbsp;<em>Otun</em>,&nbsp;<em>Osi</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Iyalode</em>&nbsp;took burdened steps towards the hut, shaking their heads in grief. She slowed down for them to go on in before she followed. On entering the hut, she fell on her knees to pay homage to Adedibu even though he had his back to them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Kabiyeeeesi o!</em>&rdquo; she greeted. &ldquo;My elders, I greet you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My daughter, you may rise.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Otun</em>&nbsp;said to her, not raising his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood up on shaky feet and wondered how long the silence would wear on before someone broke it. She didn&rsquo;t wonder for long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Eeeeeeeeeeeewo o!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</em>&rdquo; The high-pitch tone and cowries beating against bare flesh announced the arrival of&nbsp;<em>Yeye&nbsp;</em>Mofe, the High Priestess. &ldquo;<em>Kabiyesi o!</em>&rdquo; she greeted the King even though he paid her no heed. She spoke fast all the time and it made one wonder what it was that always made her pressed for time. It was unheard of for the Yeye to have a family so the only duty she had was to the village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&lsquo;Yio bale yio bale ni labalaba fi wo gbo lo.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Kaka kiku ma je sese, a fi sawada ni&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Yeye&nbsp;</em>Mofe&rsquo;s loud chanting filled the hut and Adedibu finally turned towards them, his eyes bloodshot and swollen. She knew he had been crying and it irked her that there was nothing she could do to ease her brother&rsquo;s pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A king, if he forgets who he is, will live like a common man.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Yeye</em>&nbsp;Mofe continued, chewing her mouth and looking round the room, wide-eyed. When she opened her mouth next, Adesewa knew that the High Priestess had a message to relay. Taking slow, calculated steps towards the&nbsp;<em>Kabiyesi</em>, she drew shapes in the sand and chanted. All eyes were on her as she moved and&nbsp;<em>Otun</em>,&nbsp;<em>Osi</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Iyalode</em>shared fearful glances when they realized what she was drawing.

Obasuyi</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Dear Ekiti Sons and Daughters,</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the second part of the open letter to Ekiti People on the Selection education and the future of Ekiti Development. You may wish to read the Part I of this open letter <a href=\"https://boardspeck.com/article?post=open-letter-to-ekiti-people-the-selection-education-and-the-future-of-ekiti-development-ndash-part-i&amp;id=rc2ta8ei68noe5599lp17\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. &nbsp;In part I, we discussed the deficiencies of governance and major selection principles during electioneering. In this Part II, we address the cogent and specific areas that the electorates should focus while selecting a candidate for governorship seat of Ekiti State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Section B. Further Principles of Selection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was inspired to write this Part II because of a shock I received from an undergraduate Malay Student at my University She said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ekiti State has the highest Professors in Nigeria but too poor,&rdquo; I asked her a question &ldquo;where did you get the information?&rdquo;. She replied, &ldquo;I got it online&rdquo;. Sound as a shock, right? What she believed was that education is the bedrock for any developing countries to catch up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In so doing, what should Ekiti People need to do and know to select the right candidate during the electioneering process? This section discusses the specific areas where the electorate should be patient to read. This is because the section B would educate the people of the concrete promises that they should look for in Ekiti of our dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us systematically identify our needs for the transformation of Ekiti development and Ekiti people&rsquo;s welfare. All hangs on restructuring and the readiness for change.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Political Programme and People&rsquo;s Need &ndash; </strong>Political party programme is always deficient that accommodate fragmentation, bias and sometimes contrary to the NEEDS of the people. The programmes are drawn to bribe electorate&rsquo;s conscience. We don&rsquo;t need political party programme.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion</strong><em> - People of Ekiti State should be conscious of selecting an aspirant who will be ready to allow Ekiti people to define their <strong>NEEDS</strong>. Relying on political party programmes is a <strong>SHITHOLE</strong>. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Efficient Policy &ndash; </strong>We don&rsquo;t need N500.00, N1000.00, N5000.00 and or more to bribe your conscience to which you become unhappy after the election. If you collect the money, you signed and accepted your death-economic warrant. The monies shared by politicians are poverty money that electorates take for four years. If you take N500.00, N1000.00, N5000.00, try to spend it judiciously because you may not receive similar consignment before the end of the four years. My people, we need an effective policy that will teach and direct the people to where they could get money every day. Don&rsquo;t allow the politician to give you money. Instead, tell them to have effective policy to enhance people capability of how to get their own money and they will be satisfied.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>In consequence of the above, the electorates should exercise caution in collecting money from any of the aspirants. Instead, demand for an effective policy that will upturn poverty. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>State Conference/Summit</strong> &ndash; The incoming government should agree to organise State Conference/Summit immediately after the swearing-in ceremony to design the way forward on the real and services sectors such as Agric, industry, manufacturing, SME, electricity, tourism, services and education. The summit should identify and collate the State <strong>NEEDS</strong> (People and government NEEDS). The outcome of the Conference/Summit shall be a template for running the State than <strong>GOVERNOR PRESUMED NEEDS</strong> or <strong>POLITICAL PARTY ASSUMED NEEDS</strong> for the people.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>In the spirit of development, the electorates are cautioned against a poor selection of a candidate and cast their vote for somebody who will not be interested in organising a <strong>CONFERENCE/SUMMIT</strong> as a template for Governor and the State operationalisation of development activities. It will be somehow and somewhat suicidal. Vote for a candidate that would be ready to declare state of emergency on the Ekiti State industrial sector. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Governance Inclusiveness</strong><strong> -</strong> The inclusiveness includes people&rsquo;s participation in the running of the society. I suggest that any aspirant whose interest is to govern the State by <strong>self-ideas and Godfatherism</strong> should be avoided. Godfatherism does not allow for sustainable development to take place neither a self-idea (which is controlled by emotions) cannot put food on the electorate&rsquo; tables.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion </strong><em>- Therefor</em>e, <em>the guide is to vote for a candidate who is interested in <strong>INCLUSIVENESS</strong> instead of exclusiveness. If the voters make a selection mistake of <strong>EXCLUSIVENESS</strong>, without mincing words, they will pay the prize for the error committed for four solid years. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Research and Development (R&amp;D)</strong> - The Incoming Governor should demonstrate the readiness to respect and use R&amp;D as an economic tool to upgrade the State economic development. The Incoming Governor should use experts in EKSU, College of Education and Health Technology in ensuring R&amp;D in the State. That is where the <strong>SEERS and PROPHETS of DEVELOPMENT</strong> reside. This aspect is most crucial to monitor the State development in Education, Science, Social, Business and Arts/Humanities, instead of politician&rsquo;s ideologies that are always demonstrating biasness and frustrating. A deviation or attempt to reduce these experts to non-functioning in prophesying, seeing and proclaiming several development warnings would be a <strong>CURSE</strong> for the State economic development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion </strong><em>- The electorate should be most conscious of selecting an aspirant/candidate wisely such that the person should be interested in R&amp;D. </em><strong>OK?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Interest in Development instead of Political Affiliation</strong>. The State incoming Governor should have 100% <strong>INTEREST</strong> in the State development instead of personal thinking and philosophy of the Governor regarding the State development. The Governor &lsquo;own-thought&rsquo; regarding State development is always biased than the collective thought of development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion </strong><em>- This</em><em> principle is a caution for the electorates to select an aspirant who will avoid handling governance by self-imposition but vote in a candidate who will employ collective thinking. Otherwise, be expecting that the incoming Governor with self-thinking episode would lead people to more of poverty and poor development in the State. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Restructuring of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) &ndash;</strong> Re-organisation or restructuring of the State SME to promote investment should top government and the human need to reduce unemployment. The incoming government should consciously allow for the re-organisation or restructuring of the State SME. In developed countries, the SME is largest employer of labour. Currently, I observe that the State SME is outrightly disorganised. The SMEs are not properly organised compare with Malaysia SMEs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>T</em><em>he voters (Ekiti people) should select an aspirant with the heart full of consciousness and readiness to restructure the State SME that is already in a state of a comma. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Social and Life Security</strong> &ndash; The incoming governor should demonstrate his readiness to create a secure environment for sustainable development such that the investors are attracted to invest in the State economy. The higher the number of investors, the better the State economic development. Also, the more the State absorbs insecurity, the worse the State economy. Please, ensure that the aspirants you intend to vote for have the intention to secure the State regarding property, social and life.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>In a wise saying, it is preferable to argue that a poor selection among the parties aspirants would cause the electorates and their families four-year economic and psychological stress; poverty and insecurity. So, rationally select and vote for the candidate who will be interested in your welfare, the welfare of your family and the inclusiveness of the society in ensuring social order</em><strong>. Ok</strong><em>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Government Team</strong> &ndash; The incoming Governor should demonstrate the readiness to select government team wisely. Learn from Malaysia. The government team include Commissioners, Directors, Special Advisers and others. The government portfolio should be expert focused rather than political party focused. Over time, the mistake in this aspect has ever been a <strong>CURSE</strong> for the development of the State and Nigeria economy. For example, a former Governor of Ekiti appointed a medical Doctor to manage Ministry of Education and Technology. You could recall that the Commissioner used the <strong>Medical SURGICAL BLADE</strong> to tear apart the State education.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong>Without mincing words, I suggest that potential voters<em> should select wisely among the aspirants who will not look at &ldquo;oju aye&rdquo; (eye service) but look at collective goal to choose his team. If you see any aspirant who has promised everyone before the election without consideration to expert, such a candidate is your and family enemy in governance. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Governorship Position and Administration -</strong> The Incoming Governor should know that he is the most Senior Staff or Chief Administrator of the State Administration, like a Vice-Chancellor of a University that receive a salary. Yes, Governor appointed the Vice Chancellor but the <strong>ELECTORATES</strong> <strong>APPOINTED</strong> the Governor by the signature of their votes. The incoming Governor should demonstrate in practical terms that the electorates stand as the Boss because the number of votes cast would give the incoming Governor the appointment as a Governor of the State (like a job seeker). The fact remains that people elected/appointed the Governor to serve them with a salary reward from the individual share of the State income (per capita income). As such, Governor is expected to serve as an efficient intermediary between the State economy and external economies instead of being a BOSS over the BOSS (electorates). Otherwise, the State development becomes a curse that would invite more poverty and insecurity to and for the people.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>So,</em> <em>the electorates should select a tested and efficient &ldquo;<strong>Leader&rdquo;</strong> instead of a <strong>&ldquo;Boss&rdquo;.</strong> A Boss is an authoritarian person where a Leader is an inspired individual and purely democratic (Read Daskal, 2014). If you select a &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; to be the next Governor of Ekiti State, <strong>the electorate should expect that they will live in a tyrannical society/community for four solid years, if not more, to pay for their ineptitude </strong>regarding a <strong>BOSS</strong> aspirant selected. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Ekiti State Development Plan</strong> &ndash; Passionately and critically, I observe that there is no development plan in the State. If there is, it is not followed, pushed aside or it is outdated/obsolete. The world is changing in economics, science, social, information, technology and arts every day. The incoming State Governor should, as a matter of priority and urgency, take to the House of Assembly to pass into the law of Ekiti State to draw a Five-Year Development Plan (ESFYDP) that will capture all sectors. The plan would be a template to monitor sustainable development goals (SDG) that will improve Ekiti State development and his people. In my opinion, sometimes, what the government is calling development is not the actual development expected. They are window-dressing development with no impact on the people.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>So, I suggest with all<strong> </strong>sincerity that the electorate should select a political candidate, without biasness, who will be ready to draw an economic and sustainable development plan for action, as reference a template for the incoming Governor and any government coming-up in the State. The development plan would always provide direction regarding knowledge of what had been done and what remains for action. If the electorate selected an aspirant whose interest deviates from Ekiti State Development Plan (ESDP), remember that your vote is assumed to be a signature of your wisdom or ineptitude which would dictate your family success or economic failure (poverty) for four solid years or more. If governorship candidate selection is carefully done, the ESDP shall become a State economic and development manual, and a necessity to review in every 5-year interval. It is now for an electorate to demonstrate absolute wisdom to ask a direct question from the Governorship candidate: <strong>W</strong><strong>ILL YOU AS INCOMING GOVERNOR BE READY TO DRAW A DEVELOPMENT PLAN REGARDING EKITI STATE ECONOMY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT? </strong></em><strong>Ok</strong><em>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Data as a Development Weapon</strong> - The Incoming Governor should have the characteristic of, if not available, establishing Ekiti State Department of Economics and Statistics. Why? A country or State that lack accurate statistical data on economic and social issues, and make such data available to the expected users (people and researchers) would not miraculously transform the economy. Like parents monitor the children through data provided by teachers (examination report), people, researchers, economists and socialists do. Through data, development is monitored and achieved because data offer history or trend of events. The Department in question should be independent of the Ministry of Finance, which should be headed by a Director (Economists and Statistician are preferable). The government should make the Department publish State development bi-annually/quarterly in print (Name suggestion -The State Economic Bulletin or Ekiti State Economic Monitor, like Malaysia economic Monitor) and social media such as radio and television.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion &nbsp;- </strong><em>Hence, I suggest that the electorates should be wise enough to select a virtuous person who will make transparency a watchword. &nbsp;However, suppose voters make a mistake in the political party candidate&rsquo;s selection regarding data issue that defines transparency and monitoring the State economy, (i.e. keeping the record of what was done, how it was done and what remains to be done). Be reminded that the electorates are subjecting themselves and families to abject poverty because there will be no efficiency of governance regarding the distribution of the available State economic resources. Resources would be share at Governor&rsquo;s discretion at the expense of people&rsquo;s welfare. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Efficient Communication -</strong> Readiness of the incoming Governor to develop listening ears on the matter of development is a paramount concept in the development paradigm. Communication exists when the receiver understands the content of the message of the sender. Communication breaks down when there is a misconception of the idea of the message. The misconception could lead to chaos or a state of anarchy<strong><em>. </em></strong>I want to state clearly that in a KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY, information is one of the core variables.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>As<strong> </strong>such, the electorates should be courageous to select someone who has human feelings in passing right information to the people because we are social beings whose behaviour changes either for good or bad. Be honest, wise and careful of your selection to have someone who will have a listening ear rather than a deaf ear to people&rsquo;s yearnings. Effective communication between the incoming Governor and the Ekiti People should be the watchword to the electorates in selecting the right person for Governorship. Otherwise, wait for four solid years of poverty and agony, maybe you will become wise later. Elect a candidate that is approachable and invites suggestions from the public. In other words, <strong>Public opinion</strong> <strong>should count</strong>. &nbsp;</em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Corruption Control and Strategy</strong> - Corruption is as old as man, particularly reference to when the evil angel called Satan, corruptively stole the everlasting life given to man. While I am not advocating for corruption, since the first corruption was performed in Eden, corruption has been a behaviour that occurs and reoccurs in all countries of the world. It is only the quantity and management that create the difference. For example, making pronunciation that the State or our country is corrupt is deadlier than the corruption itself because it will negatively impact more on the economy than expected. So, it is a necessary condition to ask the prospective incoming Governor, I mean all the aspirants irrespective of the political party affiliation, to tell the people the strategy of blocking the loopholes of corruptive tendencies in governance. Fighting the past corruption is good, but the approach may look worse. It is now to ask any of the aspirants the following questions. (1) What are the corruption parameters in governance, economic, social and politics? (2) How will you assure the electorates that you will not be a corrupt Governor if elected? (3) If found having the intention (still planning) of corruption (or found corrupted) during your tenure, what should Ekiti people do to minimise the propensity for corruption? Give us your word. (4) If any of your team is found corrupt, what will you do in the interest of Ekiti People and development?<em> </em>If answers are not straightforward, then be wise, patient and careful of such candidate in your selection exercise. Whatever the response, have it in writing to keep a record.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>So, I suggest that the electorates should avoid selecting an aspirant that has a corruptive tendency (in other words, traces of being a thieve), merely that he is a member of your party. Please note that when such individual buys his way from your negligence of having right person as a Governor, you and your family will pay for the proceeds of his corruption in four years or more. <strong>Ok?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>&nbsp;Wages Problem &ndash; </strong>No doubt, the economic recession has caused a lot to the workers of the State through non-payment of salary. In distribution process, the State economy depends mainly on salary to which distribution goes to the market. Get a clear understanding of the intention of the aspirant(s) of how salary issue would be resolved. The fact that the incoming Governor should know now is the 5 &ndash; 7 months arrears of salary. What Ekiti people would revolt against is telling the people what they know and experience. Instead, the electorates should ask the political party candidates to tell the electorates what and how the arrears of workers emoluments are to be paid. Otherwise, your vote would count for your persistent poverty.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion &ndash; </strong><em>When an aspirant is using the current weaknesses (such as salary arrears) of the current government to campaign to be a Governor, tell him that we are not <strong>MUNMUN</strong> who does not know right from wrong. The facts about current and previous governments are kept in the Political Bank of Lying. Instead, the electorates need to be sure that the political party candidate of their interest answer the question of HOW? and not WHAT? In other words, HOW? provides convincing and detailed answers than WHAT? to which WHAT? is a bundle of lies in a political arena. </em><strong>Ok?<em> </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this open letter (Part I&amp;II), we have discussed the weaknesses of the government and stated <em>selection principles</em> as a guide to Ekiti polity. The selection principles are guides to select from the myriads of aspirants and to prepare the winning aspirant for works ahead. So, we propose to Ekiti Sons and Daughters as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Though it is not easily said and done, do not choose an aspirant base on prejudice or be political and ethnicity bias. If all things being equal, avoid selecting a Governorship candidate merely because he is a member of your party, ethnic group, family and local government even when you have the absolute knowledge that he has little or no capacity to run the affairs of the State.</li>\r\n	<li>Select a virtuous candidate that has a passion for development, who understand the evolution of development and development stages. The person should be a <strong>LEADER</strong> and not a <strong>BOSS</strong>. As a <strong>LEADER</strong>, he should be versatile as a <strong>READER. </strong>A <strong>Reade</strong>r can be a good <strong>Leader </strong>because he acquires more knowledge and wisdom in reading but a <strong>Leader </strong>cannot necessarily be a <strong>Reader </strong>because he has characteristics of a<strong> BOSS.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Base on these conclusions, we argue that a unique thought of the electorates&rsquo; welfare, their families standard of living, the community and economic development of Ekiti State are the inherent value chains in the Selection Education Guide (SEG) provided in this open letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Admonition </strong>- Dear Ekiti Sons and Daughters, you are the electorates that should bear in mind the limitation of the selection principles as highlighted in Kolawole (2018). He said &ldquo;<em>in every election, politicians play on our intelligence and ride on our emotions. When they get power, they become something else&rdquo;</em>. To minimise the limitation, ponder over the selection principle stated in this open letter. Educate your children who are eligible (18 and above) to vote during the election so as to shine their eyes and open their brain for development reasoning. Consciously and constructively reason with your relatives and friends as well as social groups regarding these selection principles during the electioneering process of Ekiti State with an extension to Nigeria politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many are in the race, but only one person would receive the prize. The truth is that a person among the candidates would emerge as the Governor of Ekiti State. Only God Knows. In advance, I congratulate the unknown and yet decided candidate who will assume the <strong>HOT, DEMANDING and COMPETITIVE SEAT</strong> of Ekiti State. My prayer is for the electorate to make the balanced judgement of the aspirants to get the desired result of development. In so doing, the incoming Governor should not forget to avoid <strong><em>misplacement of priority in governance</em></strong>. He should allow Ekiti people to identify their <strong>NEEDS</strong> from numerous <strong>WANTS</strong> through State Conference/Summit. Make research and development (R&amp;D) a robust governance instrument to reshape and rebuild the dilapidated economy of the State, a fraction of the Nigeria economy. Be sure that you declare state of emmergency on the <strong>REAL SECTOR</strong> of Ekiti State to stimulate employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever the choice of the electorates, I have resolved to constructively provide developmental ideas, innovations and creativity (Sternberg, 2012) to whoever comes to the corridor of power in Ekiti, to proffer solutions to numerous problems of Ekiti people and the State Economy (e.g. youth unemployment). In summary, my concern is the happiness of Ekiti people and the State economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further debate shall focus on where we were coming from, where we are now and how to pursue the global SDG 2030 programme in the State. Collectively, we shall discuss what has been done, how it was done but got a failure response, what we should do and shouldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for your patience for the &ldquo;So long a Letter&rdquo;, as in Mariama B&acirc;&#39;s first novel book written in the form of a letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folorunso Obasuyi T.

(42, 'OPEN LETTER TO EKITI PEOPLE: THE SELECTION EDUCATION AND THE FUTURE OF EKITI DEVELOPMENT â€“ PART II', 'Folorunso Obayemi T. Obasuyi', 'show', '<p><em><strong>Dear Ekiti Sons and Daughters,</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the second part of the open letter to Ekiti People on the Selection education and the future of Ekiti Development. You may wish to read the Part I of this open letter <a href=\"https://boardspeck.com/article?post=open-letter-to-ekiti-people-the-selection-education-and-the-future-of-ekiti-development-ndash-part-i&amp;id=rc2ta8ei68noe5599lp17\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. In part I, we discussed the deficiencies of governance and major selection principles during electioneering. In this Part II, we address the cogent and specific areas that the electorates should focus while selecting a candidate for governorship seat of Ekiti State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Section B. Further Principles of Selection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was inspired to write this Part II because of a shock I received from an undergraduate Malay Student at my University She said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ekiti State has the highest Professors in Nigeria but too poor,&rdquo; I asked her a question &ldquo;where did you get the information?&rdquo;. She replied, &ldquo;I got it online&rdquo;. Sound as a shock, right? What she believed was that education is the bedrock for any developing countries to catch up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In so doing, what should Ekiti People need to do and know to select the right candidate during the electioneering process? This section discusses the specific areas where the electorate should be patient to read. This is because the section B would educate the people of the concrete promises that they should look for in Ekiti of our dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us systematically identify our needs for the transformation of Ekiti development and Ekiti people&rsquo;s welfare. All hangs on restructuring and the readiness for change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Political Programme and People&rsquo;s Need &ndash; </strong>Political party programme is always deficient that accommodate fragmentation, bias and sometimes contrary to the NEEDS of the people. The programmes are drawn to bribe electorate&rsquo;s conscience. We don&rsquo;t need political party programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion</strong><em> - People of Ekiti State should be conscious of selecting an aspirant who will be ready to allow Ekiti people to define their <strong>NEEDS</strong>. Relying on political party programmes is a <strong>SHITHOLE</strong>. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Efficient Policy &ndash; </strong>We don&rsquo;t need N500.00, N1000.00, N5000.00 and or more to bribe your conscience to which you become unhappy after the election. If you collect the money, you signed and accepted your death-economic warrant. The monies shared by politicians are poverty money that electorates take for four years. If you take N500.00, N1000.00, N5000.00, try to spend it judiciously because you may not receive similar consignment before the end of the four years. My people, we need an effective policy that will teach and direct the people to where they could get money every day. Don&rsquo;t allow the politician to give you money. Instead, tell them to have effective policy to enhance people capability of how to get their own money and they will be satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>In consequence of the above, the electorates should exercise caution in collecting money from any of the aspirants. Instead, demand for an effective policy that will upturn poverty. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>State Conference/Summit</strong> &ndash; The incoming government should agree to organise State Conference/Summit immediately after the swearing-in ceremony to design the way forward on the real and services sectors such as Agric, industry, manufacturing, SME, electricity, tourism, services and education. The summit should identify and collate the State NEEDS (People and government NEEDS). The outcome of the Conference/Summit shall be a template for running the State than GOVERNOR PRESUMED NEEDS or POLITICAL PARTY ASSUMED NEEDS for the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>In the spirit of development, the electorates are cautioned against a poor selection of a candidate and cast their vote for somebody who will not be interested in organising a CONFERENCE/SUMMIT as a template for Governor and the State operationalisation of development activities. It will be somehow and somewhat suicidal. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Governance Inclusiveness -</strong> The inclusiveness includes people&rsquo;s participation in the running of the society. I suggest that any aspirant whose interest is to govern the State by <strong>self-ideas and Godfatherism</strong> should be avoided. Godfatherism does not allow for sustainable development to take place neither a self-idea (which is controlled by emotions) cannot put food on the electorate&rsquo; tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion </strong><em>- Therefor</em>e, <em>the guide is to vote for a candidate who is interested in <strong>INCLUSIVENESS</strong> instead of exclusiveness. If the voters make a selection mistake of <strong>EXCLUSIVENESS</strong>, without mincing words, they will pay the prize for the error committed for four solid years. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Research and Development (R&amp;D)</strong> - The Incoming Governor should demonstrate the readiness to respect and use R&amp;D as an economic tool to upgrade the State economic development. The Incoming Governor should use experts in EKSU, College of Education and Health Technology in ensuring R&amp;D in the State. That is where the <strong>SEERS and PROPHETS of DEVELOPMENT</strong> reside. This aspect is most crucial to monitor the State development in Education, Science, Social, Business and Arts/Humanities, instead of politician&rsquo;s ideologies that are always demonstrating biasness and frustrating. A deviation or attempt to reduce these experts to non-functioning in prophesying, seeing and proclaiming several development warnings would be a <strong>CURSE</strong> for the State economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion </strong><em>- The electorate should be most conscious of selecting an aspirant/candidate wisely such that the person should be interested in R&amp;D. </em><strong>OK?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Interest in Development instead of Political Affiliation</strong>. The State incoming Governor should have 100% <strong>INTEREST</strong> in the State development instead of personal thinking and philosophy of the Governor regarding the State development. The Governor &lsquo;own-thought&rsquo; regarding State development is always biased than the collective thought of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion </strong><em>- This principle is a caution for the electorates to select an aspirant who will avoid handling governance by self-imposition but vote in a candidate who will employ collective thinking. Otherwise, be expecting that the incoming Governor with self-thinking episode would lead people to more of poverty and poor development in the State. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restructuring of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) &ndash;</strong> Re-organisation or restructuring of the State SME to promote investment should top government and the human need to reduce unemployment. The incoming government should consciously allow for the re-organisation or restructuring of the State SME. In developed countries, the SME is largest employer of labour. Currently, I observe that the State SME is outrightly disorganised. The SMEs are not properly organised compare with Malaysia SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>The voters (Ekiti people) should select an aspirant with the heart full of consciousness and readiness to restructure the State SME that is already in a state of a comma. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Social and Life Security</strong> &ndash; The incoming governor should demonstrate his readiness to create a secure environment for sustainable development such that the investors are attracted to invest in the State economy. The higher the number of investors, the better the State economic development. Also, the more the State absorbs insecurity, the worse the State economy. Please, ensure that the aspirants you intend to vote for have the intention to secure the State regarding property, social and life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>In a wise saying, it is preferable to argue that a poor selection among the parties aspirants would cause the electorates and their families four-year economic and psychological stress; poverty and insecurity. So, rationally select and vote for the candidate who will be interested in your welfare, the welfare of your family and the inclusiveness of the society in ensuring social order</em><strong>. Ok</strong><em>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><strong>Government Team</strong> &ndash; The incoming Governor should demonstrate the readiness to select government team wisely. Learn from Malaysia. The government team include Commissioners, Directors, Special Advisers and others. The government portfolio should be expert focused rather than political party focused. Over time, the mistake in this aspect has ever been a <strong>CURSE</strong> for the development of the State and Nigeria economy. For example, a former Governor of Ekiti appointed a medical Doctor to manage Ministry of Education and Technology. You could recall that the Commissioner used the <strong>Medical SURGICAL BLADE</strong> to tear apart the State education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong>Without missing words, I suggest that potential voters<em> should select wisely among the aspirants who will not look at &ldquo;oju aye&rdquo; (eye service) but look at collective goal to choose his team. If you see any aspirant who has promised everyone before the election without consideration to expert is your and family enemy in governance. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>10.&nbsp; </em><strong>Governorship Position and Administration -</strong> The Incoming Governor should know that he is the most Senior Staff or Chief Administrator of the State Administration, like a Vice-Chancellor of a University that receive a salary. Yes, Governor appointed the Vice Chancellor but the <strong>ELECTORATES</strong> <strong>APPOINTED</strong> the Governor by the signature of their votes. The incoming Governor should demonstrate in practical terms that the electorates stand as the Boss because the number of votes cast would give the incoming Governor the appointment as a Governor of the State (like a job seeker). The fact remains that people elected/appointed the Governor to serve them with a salary reward from the individual share of the State income (per capita income). As such, Governor is expected to serve as an efficient intermediary between the State economy and external economies instead of being a BOSS over the BOSS (electorates). Otherwise, the State development becomes a curse that would invite more poverty and insecurity to and for the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>So,</em> <em>the electorates should select a tested and efficient &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;Boss&rdquo;. A boss is an authoritarian where a leader is an inspired individual and purely democratic (Read Daskal, 2014). If you select a &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; to be the next Governor, <strong>the electorate should expect that they will live in a tyrannical society/community for four solid years, if not more, to pay for their ineptitude </strong>regarding a <strong>BOSS</strong> aspirant selected. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>11.&nbsp; </em><strong>Ekiti State Development Plan</strong> &ndash; Passionately, I observe that there is no development plan in the State. If there is, it is not followed, pushed aside or it is outdated/obsolete. The world is changing in economics, science, social, information, technology every day. The incoming State Governor should, as a matter of priority and urgency, take to the House of Assembly to pass into the law of Ekiti State to draw a Five-Year Development Plan (ESFYDP) that will capture all sectors. The plan would be a template to monitor sustainable development goals (SDG) that will improve Ekiti State development and his people. In my opinion, sometimes, what the government is calling development is not the actual development expected. They are window-dressing development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>So, I suggest with all<strong> </strong>sincerity that the electorate should select a political candidate, without biasness, who will be ready to draw an economic and sustainable development plan for action as a template for the incoming Governor and any government coming-up in the State. The development plan would always provide direction regarding knowledge of what had been done and what remains for action. If the electorate selected an aspirant whose interest deviates from Ekiti State Development Plan (ESDP), remember that your vote is assumed to be a signature of your wisdom or ineptitude which would dictate your family success or economic failure (poverty) for four solid years or more. If candidate selection is carefully done, the ESDP shall become a State economic and development manual, and a necessity to review in every 5-year interval. It is now for an electorate to demonstrate absolute wisdom to ask a direct question from the Governorship candidate: <strong>WILL YOU AS INCOMING GOVERNOR DRAW A DEVELOPMENT PLAN REGARDING EKITI STATE ECONOMY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT? </strong></em><strong>Ok</strong><em>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>12.&nbsp; </em><strong>Data as a Development Weapon</strong> - The Incoming Governor should have the characteristic of, if not available, establishing Ekiti State Department of Economics and Statistics. Why? A country or State that lack accurate statistical data on economic and social issues, and make such data available to the expected users (people and researchers) would not miraculously transform the economy. Like parents monitor the children through data provided by teachers (examination report), economists and socialists do. Through data, development is monitored and achieved because data offer history or trend. The Department in question should be independent of the Ministry of Finance, which should be headed by a Director (Economists and Statistician are preferable). The government should make the Department publish State development bi-annually/quarterly in print (Name suggestion -The State Economic Bulletin or Ekiti State Economic Monitor, like Malaysia economic Monitor) and social media such as radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>Hence, I suggest that the electorates should be wise enough to select a virtuous person who will make transparency a watchword. However, suppose voters make a mistake in the political party candidate&rsquo;s selection regarding data issue that defines transparency and monitoring the State economy, (i.e. keeping the record of what was done, how it was done and what remains to be done). Be reminded that the electorates are subjecting themselves and families to abject poverty because there will be no efficiency of governance regarding the distribution of the available State economic resources. Resources would be share at Governor&rsquo;s discretion. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>13. &nbsp;</em><strong>Efficient Communication -</strong> Readiness of the incoming Governor to develop listening hears on the matter of development is a paramount concept in the development paradigm. Communication exists when the receiver understands the content of the message of the sender. Communication breaks down when there is a misconception of the idea of the message. The misconception could lead to chaos or a state of anarchy<em><strong>. </strong></em>I want to state clearly that in a KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY, information is one of the core variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>As<strong> </strong>such, the electorates should be courageous to select someone who has human feelings in passing right information to the people because we are social beings whose behaviour changes either for good or bad. Be honest, wise and careful of your selection to have someone who will have a listening ear rather than a deaf ear to people&rsquo;s yearnings. Effective communication between the incoming Governor and the Ekiti People should be the watchword to the electorates in selecting the right person for Governorship. Otherwise, wait for four solid years of poverty and agony, maybe you will become wise later. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>14.&nbsp; </em><strong>Corruption Control and Strategy</strong> - Corruption as old as man, particularly when an evil angel corruptively stole the everlasting life given to man. While I am not advocating for corruption, since the first corruption was performed, corruption has been a behaviour that occurs and reoccurs in all countries of the world. It is only the quantity and management that create the difference. Making pronunciation that the State is corrupt is deadlier than the corruption itself because it will negatively impact more on the economy than expected. Ask the incoming Governor, I mean all the aspirants irrespective of the party, to tell the people the strategy of blocking the loopholes of corruptive tendencies in governance. Fighting the past corruption is good, but the approach may look worse. It is now to ask any of the aspirants the following questions. (1) What are the corruption parameters in governance, economic, social and politics? (2) How will you assure the electorates that you will not be a corrupt Governor if elected? (3) If found having the intention (still planning) of corruption (or found corrupted) during your tenure, what should Ekiti people do to minimise the propensity for corruption? Give us your word. (4) If any of your team is found corrupt, what will you do in the interest of Ekiti People and development?<em> </em>If answers are not straightforward, then be wise, patient and careful of such candidate in your selection exercise. Whatever the response, have it in writing to keep a record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion - </strong><em>So, I suggest that the electorates should avoid selecting an aspirant that has a corruptive tendency (in other words, a thieve), merely that he is a member of your party. When he buys his way from your negligence of having right person as a Governor, you and your family will pay for the proceeds of his corruption in four years or more. <strong>Ok?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>15. &nbsp;</em><strong>Wages Problem &ndash; </strong>No doubt, the economic recession has caused a lot to the workers of the State through non-payment of salary. In distribution process, the State economy depends mainly on salary to which distribution goes to the market. Get a clear understanding of the intention of the aspirant(s) of how salary issue would be resolved. The fact that the incoming Governor should know now is the 5 &ndash; 7 months arrears of salary. What Ekiti people would revolt against is telling the people what they know and experience. Instead, the electorates should ask the political party candidates to tell the electorates what and how the arrears of workers emoluments are to be paid. Otherwise, your vote would count for your persistent poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suggestion &ndash; </strong><em>When an aspirant is using the current weaknesses (such as salary arrears) of the current government to campaign to be a Governor, tell him that we are not <strong>MUNMUN</strong> who does not know right from wrong.

In other words, HOW? provides convincing and detailed answers than WHAT? to which WHAT? is a bundle of lies in a political arena. </em><strong>Ok?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this open letter (Part I&amp;II), we have discussed the weaknesses of the government and stated <em>selection principles</em> as a guide to Ekiti polity. The selection principles are guides to select from the myriads of aspirants and to prepare the winning aspirant for works ahead. So, we propose to Ekiti Sons and Daughters as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it is not easily said and done, do not choose an aspirant base on prejudice or be political and ethnicity bias. If all things being equal, avoid selecting a Governorship candidate merely because he is a member of your party, ethnic group, family and local government even when you have the absolute knowledge that he has little or no capacity to run the affairs of the State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Select a virtuous candidate that has a passion for development, who understand the evolution of development and development stages. The person should be a <strong>LEADER</strong> and not a <strong>BOSS</strong>. As a <strong>LEADER</strong>, he should be versatile as a <strong>READER. </strong>A <strong>Reade</strong>r can be a good <strong>Leader </strong>because he acquires more knowledge and wisdom in reading but a <strong>Leader </strong>cannot necessarily be a <strong>Reader </strong>because he has characteristics of a<strong> BOSS.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Base on these conclusions, we argue that a unique thought of the electorates&rsquo; welfare, their families standard of living, the community and economic development of Ekiti State are the inherent value chains in the Selection Education Guide (SEG) provided in this open letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Admonition </strong>- Dear Ekiti Sons and Daughters, you are the electorates that should bear in mind the limitation of the selection principles as highlighted in Kolawole (2018). He said &ldquo;<em>in every election, politicians play on our intelligence and ride on our emotions. When they get power, they become something else&rdquo;</em>. To minimise the limitation, ponder over the selection principle stated in this open letter. Educate your children who are eligible (18 and above) to vote during the election so as to shine their eyes and open their brain for development reasoning. Consciously and constructively reason with your relatives and friends as well as social groups regarding these selection principles during the electioneering process of Ekiti State with an extension to Nigeria politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many are in the race, but only one person would receive the prize. The truth is that a person among the candidates would emerge as the Governor of Ekiti State. Only God Knows. In advance, I congratulate the unknown and yet decided candidate who will assume the number one office of Ekiti State. My prayer is for the electorate to make the balanced judgement of the aspirants to get the desired result of development. In so doing, the incoming Governor should not forget to avoid misplacement of priority in governance. He should allow Ekiti people to identify their <strong>NEEDS</strong> from <strong>WANTS</strong> through State Conference/Summit. Make research and development (R&amp;D) a robust governance instrument to reshape and rebuild the dilapidated economy of the State/Nigeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever the choice of the electorates, I have resolved to constructively provide developmental ideas, innovations and creativity (Sternberg, 2012) to whoever comes to the corridor of power in Ekiti, to proffer solutions to numerous problems of Ekiti people and the State Economy (e.g. youth unemployment). In summary, my concern is the happiness of Ekiti people and the State economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further debate shall be on where we were from, where we are now and how to pursue the global SDG 2030 programme in the State. Collectively, we shall discuss what has been done, how it was done but got a failure response, what we should do and shouldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for your patience for the &ldquo;So long a Letter&rdquo;, as in Mariama B&acirc;&#39;s first novel book written in the form of a letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folorunso Obasuyi T.

(kudos to Nigerian parents though, that&#39;s when they&#39;ll start with the eulogies which will bend you against your will)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know, I, Tapa Seriki, I&#39;m a well known doctor, owning lots of hospitals in the nation and beyond and if you don&#39;t become a doctor, who will take my place?So, you want to study law and tarnish the image that led you to becoming this great man/woman?No my dear, you cannot study law, you have no say in this.You just have to become a doctor&rdquo; (this occurs mostly to children from a family of 3 (a single child and parents)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>but they do not think or care less about the passion of the child, about the gift and divine knowledge of the child but decide to enforce their will on such a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a reason why Evg. Ebenezer Obey said in his song &ldquo;If you notice a child likes to play(with) the guitar, let him, he might be the next commander (himself)&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>which seems to mean that parents should try to encourage the children do what they love or what they are interested in(if it is moral), more than what they ourselves want us to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the question is left to you to answer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many people have been forced to agree to the fact that since they are the sole survivors of their family, they are the only ones who can continue to build the family&#39;s lineage and thereby create a mindset for themselves that they are the ones who can keep it going but then, to do that, they (most) end up neglecting themselves (their true potentials, their real talent, their true call), just because they think it is better to keep the family&#39;s lineage in order.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>parents should try to encourage the children do what they love or what they are interested in(if it is moral), more than what they ourselves want us to.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So many have lost it in life because of this simple factor, they want to do their parent&#39;s wish and when some discover that they cannot, they get frustrated some even go to the extent of hurting themselves or doing worse things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can imagine someone who might have been a great physicist, had great compassion/flair for studying scientific tools, making outstanding world-building thesis and so much more, might have been a great asset to the country and the world in all, but being forced to study Law because Dad&#39;s a lawyer and Mum is as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had to study law and was forced to become one,this unfortunately caused her to lose her flair for scientific matters, but layer on she ends up discovering that her life isn&#39;t for Law but Science (Physics)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can imagine how she&#39;ll feel, so many people live with this everyday of their lives, the fact that they lost it due to the talks they allow into them, through people, circumstances and others situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, back to you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has this occurred to you before?Have you had something you really want to do?Have you had a flair for architecture, drawing, tailoring, shoe making and so much more?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were you stopped just because they think these things are irrelevant?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What did you do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you too agree after being cajoled for a while?I always tell people who come to me with this;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;YOUR PARENTS ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE YOUR LIFE, THEY&#39;LL LIVE THEIRS AND DIE, THEN YOU&#39;LL BE LEFT WITH YOURSELF!ARE YOU PLANNING TO LIVE FOR THEM TILL THEN?IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s quite simple to break from these</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

He has been locked up in\r\na God knows where mental rehabilitation centre for like four to five\r\nweeks now and he still couldn\'t think straight why that should be the\r\nnext point of action in his life. He looked depressed and opposite of\r\nwhat he was in his former life.  He wished he had never met that\r\npsycho Vivian girl. She ought to be the one tied to the hospital bed\r\nand not him. He knew nobody would hear him out but he won\'t stop\r\ncausing destiny for selling him out to a cheap liar like the girl that\r\nsent him to a rehab.  He hadn\'t recover from the effect of the\r\nmedication he was given before dozing off when the bell rang for\r\nmorning prayer and he mustn\'t miss the sermon if That\'s the only thing\r\nthat can change him and give him another opportunity to lead a better\r\nlife. He likes the Reverend father that preaches at the morning mass,\r\nhe is not a black man like him and this is why he loves his sermon\r\nfrom heaven come to earth.  He takes life so easy and talks about\r\nheaven like he has been there before. He knew his late father will be\r\nangry with him for believing a white man fairy tale but it\'s better\r\nthan that of those black holyghost fire men in his village.\r\n\r\nShe lied about every thing to him except her unending love for him.\r\nHe was too young to know the true meaning of love when he met Vivian.\r\nThey both started as secondary school friends before they grew to live\r\nwithout eachother.

(78, 'Is Education Actually a Right In Nigeria', 'Peter Oyebanji', 'show', '<p>The debate whether education is a right or a privilege is dying with much speed to say the least, you hardly see anyone come out to yarn about how education is a privilege as against the popular belief that it is a right. How did it start at first? Because it&#39;s even factual, as there is a provided article for it in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 26 of the declaration states:<br />\r\n(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.<br />\r\n(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.<br />\r\n(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThis is clear enough. This is how it should be, but is this how it is?&nbsp;<br />\r\nFine, it&#39;s actually true that most countries do not meet this standards. In fact, only about six (6) countries in the world run free education in the tertiary level. United States of America is among the top five countries in the world that charge the highest fees in public colleges, only in elementary stage is public education free in USA. Considering the economy system and statistics that have shown how some Americans find it difficult to bag a degree due to high costs, you can conclude that education is not affordable there. If education isn&#39;t affordable, is it still a right? Well, may be to some extent but at least they are not far from the human rights declaration.&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhat other countries know about the situation of education in Nigeria is what they see, what they see is statistics. The statistics are terrible enough but ask an average Nigerian that has passed through or is in the system, you will wow at the level of rottenness in the country&#39;s education system. If the statistics are terrible, what will an indepth analysis look like? Sigh.&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe currently have the largest number of out-of-school youths. We have the 7th largest population in the world of more than one hundred and ninety (190) million people, United States is the third with a population of more than three hundred and twenty five (325) million people. United States has over 2000 colleges while we don&#39;t have up to 500 tertiary institutions. The thing here is the govt doesn&#39;t see this as a paramount issue as just 7 percent was allocated to the education sector in ths year&#39;s budget. Other countries are working towards making education in all stages affordable and meeting the UNESCO standard, Nigeria is working towards making the privilege one-sided. With the recent trend about increase in school fees of public universities, we can start picturing a scene where the poor won&#39;t be able to attend public universities in the country.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAn average Nigerian is being forced to think he is privileged&nbsp; to be a secondary school graduate. To pass examination is even a privilege, for example: to pass WAEC (West Africa Examination Council), you have to have a parent who can afford to pay for private schools&#39; centres&nbsp; where examination malpractice is staggering. The unexplainable rate of failures in public schools is untackled, which makes some students abandon their dreams after much tries. The fee to register for the examinations in private schools is more than the country&#39;s minimum wage. Is that close to being a right?&nbsp;<br />\r\nThey&#39;ve been investigative reports about the ingrained corruption in universities, the most recent one i have read is how the management of Obafemi Awolowo University, a foremost school in the country mismanaged the needs assessment fund provided by govt. Things like this don&#39;t get attended to by the govt. To pass examinations nowadays does not depend on how intelligent or prepared you are, you have to be privileged to have lecturers who want to have sex with you to pass an exam you didn&#39;t fail in the first place.&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe are a developing country. I don&#39;t expect the same number of tertiary institutions as it is in the United States neither do I expect zero tuition fee in our institutions just like Germany. We have the resources to achieve these standards, a kindly reminder that students in our public institutions once enjoyed free meals.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe main reason for this article is to make known that the state of education in Nigeria is far worst than what the statistics show and our energy should be channeled into fixing the education sector instead of jumping a lot of hurdles to talking about free tertiary education. There are lots of problems listed in this article, a country that has these problems should be aiming to fix its education sector not allocating seven (7) percent of its budget to the department.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs much as all Nigerians want education to be free in all stages, it should be done systematically. Realistically, we can&#39;t achieve that with our current system. It takes a lot of changes from the the top to the bottom. Germany personal income tax is almost up to fifty (50) percent, tho Germany&#39;s minimum wage is not fifty (50) dollars. Over half of Nigerians don&#39;t even pay income tax, what does that portray?&nbsp;<br />\r\nPutting into consideration how the management of universities that should know better treat students, you will think we should still be debating if freedom of speech is actually a right or a privilege.&nbsp;<br />\r\nPeter Oyebanji is a campus journalist at Obafemi Awolowo University and can be reached through Gmail: adewuyipeter50@gmail.com&nbsp; &nbsp; Twitter: @anderpeter2&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/706449WhatsApp_Image_2018-08-22_at_7.30.08_PM.jpeg', '8e1t86er265564P', '13:08:34', '2018-08-23', '7acr25li27146i25set', 1, 'thumb/8819818thumb1535117389.jpg', 0, 425, NULL),

It is indeed true. And today, I will be allowing you a sneak peak into a young girls life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s this young girl named Nina. She is the only female child in a family of four. She has always sought her parents approval in everything she does especially that of her mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a very young age, she developed the art of making people&#39;s hair. She has always looked forward to the day she will perfect her craft and proceed in this craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has always dreamt of been successful but never for once has this dream consist of anything related to education. She has always found herself in a shop making people&#39;s hair and through that became a successful woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her family is made up of elites. Her mum is a lectural, the first born of the family has two degrees, the second two certificates and the the third, a certificate and a programmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her mother has always been proud of her brothers. And she didnt want to make her mother furious and disappointed so kept her dream yo herself. The determination not to disappoint her mother pushed her forward in her education always aiming to be the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, she was. She passed WAESSC without a single blotch. She passed excellently that she didn&#39;t even bother to check her NECO result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She waited two years before she got an admission into the university and as usual, the determination not to disappoint her mother still pushed her forward in her education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on getting to the university, everything changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not because she joined a bad gang or because she name wayward. No. She wasn&#39;t any of those things. Infact, she was an introvert. She doesn&#39;t have friends, doesn&#39;t party, doesn&#39;t drink. She stays in her room reading both academic books and novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&#39;s a little difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fire is no more there. She reads and read but when the result comes out, its nothing to write home about. The determination not to disappoint her mum is still there, but its not urging her forward in her education like before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that comes to her mind now is the very same dream she buried inside of her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her third year in the university, she could bear it anymore and the fact that she doesn&#39;t like the course she was given one bit complicated matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon seeing her results, she wasn&#39;t sure she would make it into 400l but as usual, she keeps a positive mind but the difference there now is she regrets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She regrets not telling her mum what she wanted to become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She regrets pursuing even when she knows her passion doesn&#39;t lie in what is was doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people in the world her like Nina. They pursue their parents dream for them but forget about their own dream for their life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&#39;ve forgotten that their parents are only playing their role. They allow family members to steer them what they never wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They live peoples dream while theirs lies forgotten in their mind. Some are not even like Nina who couldn&#39;t cope. Some made it, graduating in flying colours but never happy nor were they satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am sure if Nina developed the courage to tell her mother, she would have understood. Even though she might av been angry but I was sure, she would have gotten over it with time. But now, Nina stays in her crying because she doesn&#39;t have the heart to show her mum her results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t be like Nina. Chase your dreams. Anchor your own future. Receive guidance from your parents and family but never let them coerce you into living their dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some will tell you they want 1st class honors from you because they couldn&#39;t get it. Some will want you to study a course because it was their dream course but they couldn&#39;t stugy it while some demands these things because they want you to be successful but they&#39;ve forgotten you&#39;re the only one responsible for your future</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>TAKE CHARGE TODAY.

Most fatal accidents are caused by the victims themselves but the perspective of the masses in accident is that drivers are always at fault. &nbsp; &nbsp;Myself have also been stocked by this ill thought that drivers are always at fault for any accident but my personal sentiment saved me as I looked and observed the happenings in our environment.. I got to know that most victims of accident have been unconsciously caught by sleep before the accident, not all become unconscious after the incident.In a case where a passenger sleeps off as soon as he or she board a vehicle,you can imagine how a totally relaxed person can struggle for survival..Of course everyone doesn\'t sleep when traveling as we have those who are scared of the unknown and those who are anxious to get to their destination, these are the conscious ones but most of them don\'t strife to survive first during an accident, they mostly put their treasures and other valuables first, \'oh what foolishness \'.I don\'t know how many years its gonna take humans to understand that \"it is only when you have life in you that you have the right to own a property\" &nbsp; For instance,I saw a man sleeping on an opened carrier of a truck,this man might be tired or maybe he could just feel like taking a nap buh definitely shouldn\'t be &nbsp;on a moving truck which has its carrier loaded with tons of cements and blocks, if any accident should occur, this man is liable to sustain a fatal injury or worst still,death. As he is not conscious of his environment at the moment. &nbsp; Another incident we all know about is the incident at the Lagos-Ibadan express way( ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ NIGERIA) &nbsp;, in a country where we don\'t have a seperated lane for tankers and other trailers to move, alertness and smartness is required. A tank filled with petrol tripped and fell, turning upside down, instead of deliberating on how to survive, they were trying to reverse in order to bring their cars to safety on an already trafficked road.At the long run, the tank leaked and the lane is on fire...The first step they should have taken(which is running far away from the scene) became their last step but its too late as they were all burnt beyond recognition. Now to the questions: &nbsp;How many instances do I need to give? &nbsp; How many signs and warnings do I have to make? &nbsp;For how long will we pass all blames on the government for not construction good and tarred roads? &nbsp; How many times are we going to pay dearly for our foolishness? &nbsp; Its high time we woke up from this mess!! &nbsp;Wake up! &nbsp;Nigeria, just because he is called the driver does not give you the right to let your guard down, you can as well direct and control the driver as long as you know the basics of driving.. Don\'t leave it all to him, he\'s not an Island of knowledge neither is he the Mr perfect that has never and will never exist. &nbsp; &nbsp;Be watchful &nbsp; Be careful &nbsp; Be conscious &nbsp;Together we can make our society a safe place to be. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/153588715276361car-accident-attorney-car-insurance.jpg', '1535797321gigeml4381o7a448bawu68', '15:37:14', '2018-09-01', '15358162348ancad74e3cir2ie6t8t148lc', 1, 'thumb/8191734thumb1535911294.jpg', 0, 370, NULL),

And this is achievable when we break away from the shackles of defining ourselves by our limitations but focusing on our possibilities, and building on our strength and potentials. Yes, this can be attainable when we update and expose ourselves first as instructors and then, make our classes and classrooms a global one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, it is high time we stopped thinking and reasoning for our students when we teach and access them. Hence, we must place our students at a spot where they can relearn by themselves whatever we have taught them. They must be able to relate what we have taught with their own experiences and present them to us in their own words from their own understanding. By so doing, we will be surprised at how their creativity will give birth to innovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, we can mend the future situation of failed leadership in West Africa and its environ when we catch our students young and initiate them into the clan of academic and social responsibilities. Yes, we can build them to take charge of the class sometimes and assign them with roles within the school. More so, we can enhance team spirit in them alongside orientating them on the essence of good moral values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it bores down to us to see it as a priority to enable a platform of communication and collaboration for our students. We must create rooms for clear expression of thoughts and opinions by doing more of interactive learning and less of talking alone for them to learn. In other words, we can assign our students with tasks that only collaboration can solve. And thus, our students&rsquo; default mind-set about tasks will be that, together everyone can achieve more. Over and beyond, if we could be honest and would adopt and implement these points with sincerity in our various institutions, we would successfully tackle the challenges our education now and in the future. Besides, we too3 will also become testifiers of the American author, Leo Buscaglia, who said, &ldquo;Change is the end result of good learning.&rdquo; Thank you.</p>', 'uploads/15358824027604263images.jpg', '7NEO0I762M15TI661HLI', '10:00:03', '2018-09-02', '1535882403iugnii66545er2c4s2as3talnt', 1, 'thumb/15358824021027322images.jpg', 1, 512, NULL),

People find this very easy to believe but difficult to understand. &nbsp; Whenever the cause of nature comes around,we all tend to believe its nature but never understood why it happened. Although,nobody can understand the will of nature but i&#39;ll like us to remember the law of &quot;karma&quot;which is also the law of nature which states that &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after when we already know the result and outcome of somethings we do, we still rush all blames on nature when its actually our doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course,nature cause happens accidentally but we should always be careful on how to control it instead of cursing and lamenting.

Listening to different stories and even motivational tips keeps me growing and also enhancing my knowledge of how people don\'t care about you unless they see you around and they want something from you. I spent most of my quality time listening to different news and entertaining gist but I was battered because I couldn\'t have access to pictorial evidence of most of the stories I was hearing and it really made me go crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After much consultation from those that could help me add up money to get a new phone and nothing positive came out of the long wait . I checked the total amount of money in my account and I knew deep down in me that it ain\'t enough to get a good andriod phone which could meet my spec but I just got a spirit telling me to go out there and price a phone and see if I can still get a phone to manage for the main time and lo and behold I followed my heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon, I summoned the courage and I went to a phone outlet not too far from where I was working with an amount that I know ain\'t enough to get a good phone. I priced different kind of phone that met my spec but the fund ain\'t enough to get one but I was surprised when a lady at the shop outlet kept persuading me to point to the phone of my choice that she would make sure I get a phone before leaving the phone outlet that day and God had his way that very day, she and another lady added money up and balanced up the money for the phone and I became the owner of a phone which actually met my spec. I learnt a lesson that no matter what you think about your incapability of doing something ,God will always surprise you if he ain\'t done with you yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I got home that same Tuesday evening with just #150 richer than the rest of the world. I charged my new phone and I on my data and update myself with what\'s happening around me and check out some messages on my WhatsApp and it\'s obvious that some people missed me in my absence while some don\'t even know I was offline for some times but at the end of it all I got to know that someone needs me to put smile on his/her face and I went on with my usual habit of cracking jokes in my Alma matas group chat and the group became lively again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Later that night I got a call from a street friend of mine who needed me to help him sell an iTunes card and here I am again with a little change in my account the following morning and then I remembered the saying \"you can wake up to be a wealthy man\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I hadn\'t summed up the courage to walk into that phone outlet even when I add an insufficient fund with me to get that phone , I wouldn\'t have access to the little change I got from the sales of the iTunes card and I wouldn\'t be able to crack up the ribs of my old school mates who had been silent on the group chat for days .

You were excited about many things, the friends you were planing on having, graduating with a first class, the freedom you are enjoying, and the allowance you were going get from home, bla bla bla.</p><p>The first few weeks were exciting, you got your fresh notes and some textbooks requested by the lecturer, &nbsp;you sat at the front of the class, your notes were very complete and neat, you met some freshmen &nbsp;like yourself. You had in mind that it\'s going to be all rosy till the end. <strong>Yes</strong>! the end, that\'s when your are all called to come get your certificate, I mean, the paper you worked four or five years.</p><p>One day, you were few minutes late, you had issues with the bike man who couldn\'t give you your change on time, the lecturer was already in class and you saw your mates writing In a sheet of paper oh my God!!! Test!!!

You blamed the bike man for not getting change on time, you blamed your self for not leaving the hostel early enough, you blamed everyone that made you late, your parents that didn\'t rent the apartment closer to School because of money. Few minutes you started talking to the other colleagues and that were outside with you. You guys spoke in anger but your voice where like that of the mouse, you couldn\'t risk the lecturer hearing you. You made friends with them, collected their numbers and went home together.</p><p><br>Months latter, you are now in 200 level, you changed your wears and needed to impress your new friends so you spent your allowance on cloths and shoes. Finally, you blended in.</p><p><br>Today was another day, you came late, the lecturer sent you out but this time you weren\'t moved at all, instead you were glad because your friends weren\'t in school, you were Eager to go meet them so you went there. You guys spoke for long, they brought &nbsp;out cigarette you took some, it didn\'t kill you and you felt normal. You took more and more then you got high and couldn\'t go to school the second day.</p><p>Now you saw your results, your CGPA was 9ft below average, but you didn\'t care about it, all you cared about was going to club with your friends. You were both sad and happy at the same time, your friends were buying new stuffs but you couldn\'t afford it, you got sidelined. This was painful, and made you not to sleep all night. Thinking about how to make money, buy cars like your friends and date girls, you became desperate that you couldn\'t take it no more, you swallowed your pride and asked for help from the same friend\'s that left you hanging.</p><p>Few months later you joined the car owners gang, you started sleeping with girls, you made more and more money, you became lucky and got richer clients.<br>Yes client! you became a Yahoo guy and you used diligently the charm the herbalist gave you, now your friends who introduced you became jealous and stopped taking to each other hence, you started doing stuffs alone.</p><p>Now you made more money and bought new car, everyone liked you most especially girls who want to benefit from your wealth. You became so popular that your lecturers began to respect you, everything was great.</p><p>Now you are in your final year, your results changed direction, your CGPA gained little value because you paid your lecturers off and they gave you marks in return. Everything was going well Until one day, things went south, you became broke and your clients were no longer paying, EFCC caught up with you and you used all your savings to bail yourself, you sold your car, your chains &nbsp;and your other phones, but was still confident that you will bounce back, you started collecting stuffs on credit &nbsp;hoping you will soon return to the good old days but unfortunately nothing came, you became a debtor and hid yourself from people you owe, you can no longer maintain your girlfriends so they left, you couldn\'t pay lecturers so your CGPA dropped, now you got more furious and went back to the herbalist. He gave you a confirmation that you can no longer get such amount of money you made &nbsp;until 40 years of age and at that point you were just in your early 20s you couldn\'t hold it anymore and opted for other options. Blood money!.</p><p>You did the undoable and was successful in your evil doings. Things got back to normal and you became richer than you were, your bought bigger cars, paid your debts, lecturers, got new girls and everyone envied you.</p><p>Few months latter, you graduated but you were not happy, everyday you remember what the herbalist told about limitation that propelled your money. You remembered he told you that you have few years to I live. You became depressed and began to hear noises, you felt uncomfortable like your flesh was leaving your body, to cries of the lady you used for ritual played in your head and you almost ran mad. Your new friends left you and became lonely, you have a lot of money but zero happiness. You were disappointed and remembered when you came Into School, you remembered your plans and was disappointed, you envied your colleagues who remained at the front sit, but you couldn\'t flip back the coin.

(136, 'The Amazing Caregiver (Mama)', 'Akole Banji', 'show', '<p>Warning! This is not a literature class...might not be too grammatical....</p><p>Like some of you would have known...about some level of \"hardheadedness\" that\'s in my makeup. So, while every child goes to school those days (Nursery), I wouldn\'t want to leave \"Mama\" alone. Any attempt to make me cooperate at school will end in futility, as there is nothing the teachers (Tough or Tender) can do about it. So the deal was, Mama must be on the school premise with me before any form of learning could take place as far as I Akole Banji Mayowa is concerned, the proprietor Late Prof Olofinboba agreed to that. So, Mama backs me to Bobas Nursery and Primary School, she waits while I file up with other kids. At will, I would peep to confirm that she\'s still around, else, hell lets loose for the day.</p><p>We have to march to the classroom to commence the day\'s academic activity, but she canâ€™t go. She would sit where I must be able to confirm by merely looking out towards the classroom door. If I ever assume that she\'s not there, being an assumption doesn\'t change the fact that learning just ended for the day. She must be there till short break when playing with other kids would have eaten deep into my emotions enough to forget that Mama has left. (I am sure the teachers would watch me and give her signs that it\'s time to disappear). By 1pm she\'s back to pick me as I ride home on my Mercedes Benz, her back. Did I forget to tell you that the day starts for her when my dream start getting interesting? 4AM as she prepares the morning meal, Wakes me, Baths me, and feeds me with food. Reminds me it\'s time to go. I am \"happy to comply\" as long as my compliance shall be rewarded with our going together. This was a routine for years.</p><p>Sometimes I become a mock of many big mouths as she backs me till I was 6...shameful it is...a lot of people call that \"Akebaje\", but for her, She has a \"philia\" for her children and grandchildren, and cannot look away when they need her tender care and touch.</p><p>Should I talk about how I follow her about everywhere she goes...even when she wants to go to the loo at night...she can\'t leave me there...we have to go together...cos I will hold-on tight except if she was lucky and sleep got the better of me already. Sometimes I trouble her until she would fake a faint. Okay!, I would scream around the neighborhood and break the news, crying that she is dead, that my lover is gone...crying to the last drop of my tears, while people rush out of their respective houses, rooms, kitchens, toilets as the case may be. When they come, to find out it was just a drama, all in an attempt to let MAMA rest. I have to take an oath that I won\'t trouble her again, as they would ask repeatedly, \"Would you disturb her again?\" I respond if my voice is not gone already, \"No! I wonâ€™t disturb her again\", and if my voice is gone already, I shake my head sideways and profusely to their outmost confidence that I meant it this time. Even if Thomas was there present, he wouldnâ€™t doubt my promise, seeing the confluence of many rivers at my chin, whose source is barely traceable as they come running from the mouth, nose, two or one of the eyes. But trust me...that\'s not a good one because for the rest of the day, if she sleeps...I would touch her to confirm her \"Live Status\". I would watch her for the rest of the day to ensure she doesn\'t faint again, making promises every 10 minutes about how I would never disturb her again. That in itself is another disturbance that I am sure she never anticipated, but she just got herself into that anyways. My mum once tried such theatrics to fake a faint. I am sure she would wonder why \"kolewerk\" was what she got. It was obvious that she was faking it, the reaction would only work for Mama, with her, I can never take the chance of thinking it was a joke cos it happened more than once and people would be like...â€Chai..Mama and this boy againâ€. So our audience reduced overtime cos someone cannot come and have hypertension because of \"One Troublesome Boy and His Grandmother\" Season 3.</p><p>Mama would always keep special food for everyone to eat after school. This special food is not to the awareness of â€œMumâ€. Cos she still wants us to get extra preparation from that side. So we would eat that before mum comes from work. This wonderful afternoon, Mum came earlier than I did. I met mum and Mama at the sitting room. Mama would not want Mum to know she kept food for the child when Mama didnâ€™t offer anything to Mum even if she asked, cos she was not considered for the preparation. As I entered, greeted both of them, surprised that mum is home by this time. Mumâ€™s arrival used to be after 4pm, but what changed? Notwithstanding, Mama gave me a sign. I decoded the sign to be â€œGO TO THE USUAL PLACEâ€. So I hurried there, confirmed that itâ€™s really there. I was so excited, it was too muchâ€¦so I hurried back to whisper to Mamaâ€™s hear, â€œShould I eat everything?â€ and she whispered back, â€œYes!â€ So, I went back eating and Joyful, a lot going through my mind, â€œWao! Today is a great day, I feel blessed and honored...â€ALL OF THIS WONDERFUL? Oh My God! This is life of my head that I am eatingâ€. Only to suddenly hear a scream of â€œEepa, inyomoo(Ekiti Dialect)â€ meaning, â€œYeeh! Look at this childâ€. I didnâ€™t know I got the wrong package. It was a combo (Groundnut and Popcorn) that someone who came around gave to her to deliver to someone else. It was so much that my conscience was telling me, â€œOh God! This canâ€™t be meâ€. She kept on pondering the particular statement, â€œHave I given you this kind of food before?â€ But, as for me, I came to ask if in should eat everything? And she said â€œyesâ€. What we were keeping from mum could no longer stay so, we had to bring her in. Guess what? She gave me the original package that was meant for me and I enjoyed it altogether.</p><p>This care was not just a thing of my younger age. She continues to wake early morning till the last of us finished at least 3rd year of junior secondary school. But she continued to care till this present moment. I can\'t recollect the number of Chicken-Turned-Tinko (Dried Meat) that I ate. She would smoke the chicken or any kind of meat every day, just because I was not around During Sallah or for Eid-de-anyone. Till I come back from Lagos, Anambra or wherever I was. No one dares touch it, even to promise a replacement. If she has mentioned that this is for \"Mayowa\", so be it. She knows how to keep it away from the awareness of the minor residents, the four legged short fellows, the custodians and sole occupants of cupboards. She would keep it anyways, till I come knocking, she would have prepared meals to welcome me back home. \"This is rice...would you eat roasted corn...I just boiled plantain...would you eat?\" While I struggle to finish the many different kinds of desserts I said yes to, here she comes...\"I am about to cook yam, would you eat.\" \"Eeehhh? O ti to\"...I would respond with a mouth full of whatever was next on the agenda. All of the time, all of it, the next question after \"welcome\" is \"Have you eaten?\", and after eating, it would be \"Are you okay\"...and after a yes response...there would be a promise of the next one that might come in a couple of hours.<br>One would have asked, am I the only Grandchild child? NO! Did she care for the rest this way? Thunderous Yes! But theirs is not the story for this time.</p><p>Why have I taken time to write about this many stories? I just realized that all that I am today and about to become in future, there is an unmentioned causative agent. Someone who was there from the \"pre-natal\" period till date. The best person whose face I have hardly posted on my social media. The rear gem. The amazing caregiver who was accused many times of wanting to â€œspoil the childâ€, but she never did. She was just extending her loving kindness towards ensuring that the child gets the best of care in life. She is still much with us and I can only pray that God in his infinite mercy should preserve her for us in good health, so that she would continue to eat the fruits of her labor. Mama Mi, I will never forget your love and care for me, your love from here to the moon and back. You will enjoy more and more peace forever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15437689097505314grandmother-african-american-portrait-old-woman-vector-20740868.jpg', 'j90819542aBn72i', '16:41:49', '2018-12-02', '1543768909tl4r9h32a8c85i2et1e1', 1, 'thumb/15437689097408703grandmother-african-american-portrait-old-woman-vector-20740868.jpg', 1, 622, NULL),
(137, 'BROKEN', 'Ifedapomola Deborah', 'hide', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BROKEN<br>&nbsp;It got to a point in your life where you stopped fighting with you and asked yourself why are you angry all this while. Well, it is not the same for everyone, but categorically for people who are egotistical, self-ambitious and selfish like me. Firstly, despite the fact that my Dad was a faithful servant of God he could not heal him and watched him died. He watched my mother suffered in the hands of my Dad\'s family who rendered us homeless. My mom would hawk vegetables just to feed her children. She would come back home tired, feeling body pain and her feet swollen from trekking and she would still fry akara till 10pm. Yet, my mother call on this God who allow us to go through this suffering. My brother was able to get a scholarship to study abroad. He didn\'t look back home. Still, she blessed God for this ungrateful son of hers. I watched my sister singing in choir, always full of happiness serving in the church. At a point, our pastor made reference to her saying \"ladies in church should emulate my sister\'s service toward God and people\". Despite all these, those so-called brothers ended up breaking her heart. At last, she got married. Five years after marriage, she was unable to have a child. Her husband sent her away yet, she remain faithful to Him.I vowed I won\'t end up in situation like theirs, so I brace myself up. I\'m not an atheist, I believe in God, many things in this world prove his existence. I just don\'t believe in resting all my hopes in him because he will always allow you to suffer yet those who don\'t believe in him flourish. So right from my childhood, I wasn\'t going to let anything back me down. I won the best graduating student in my set. I had the best WAEC result across the state. I entered University with two scholarship awards and I graduated as the overall best student. Currently, I\'m the branch manager of a bank. I had a flair for fashion, so I own a boutique that contains gorgeous designer dresses. I was able to bring out my mom out of penury. She lives in a good house and has her own car. I employed a driver and a maid for her. I had a wonderful boyfriend. I did all these without His help.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; After my usual visit to my mother on Saturday, she called me and said \"Omolara, I hope you acknowledge His Presence in your life\". This is not the first time she said it, she was not the first person to tell me this. But this time, I didn\'t argue. \"Alright\", I replied and left. I feel so empty. I don\'t even understand my life anymore. I wished I could call out to God for assistance. I needed peace but I just can\'t bring myself down to him. After all, I made it without Him and I thought I could go through this without him but I can\'t hold it any longer. I feel like committing suicide. Then my phone rang. It was my sister. She never left me alone. She was like an anchor. I don\'t understand how she remain happy without husband yet her mates are having kids. I was actually waiting for the day she would get married before I say \"yes\" to any man. At least, that\'s what I can do for her despite all what she has done for me. She noticed I was crying over the phone, \"Lara mi, what happened? Why are you crying? What happened between you and Bode?\" Before I could give her an answer, it was a total blackout.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; I woke up next morning seeing two people beside me. I couldn\'t recognize them at first until my sister spoke. \"She\'s awake\". \"Praise God, How are you doing?\" the man asked. My sister assisted me to sit up and rest on the pillow. \"I\'m feeling better, what happened?\" I asked them. \"You ran into a pole while driving and Olaoluwa\" &nbsp;pointing to the man beside her \"save your life and called me afterwards\" she explained. \"Thank you very much sir\". I said. Luckily, Olaoluwa was my sister\'s friend while they were in university. I pleaded with My sister not to tell my mother what happened. Olaoluwa and my sister never left my side throughout my stay in the hospital. My boyfriend was around too. I got to know Olaoluwa better, he is very nice man. He said his mother didn\'t want him to get married &nbsp;to a white woman that\'s why he is in Nigeria. As times goes on, the friendship between My sister and him grew stronger. Before I knew it, he proposed to her. Five months later my sister announced that she is pregnant. My mother\'s joy knew no bound even my eyes were filled with tears of joy. Before my sister left the country with her husband, she said the same thing my mother had said. \"I hope you acknowledge His Presence in your life. He is ever waiting for you\" and pulled me into her arms.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So one night, I brought out the bible she gave me and read a portion of it. It was as if the verse was talking to me. I said, God, I\'m sorry. I know several times you have been calling me, yet I was too proud to obey your voice. Please forgive me. I need peace. I need peace of mind. I wept profusely but rising from the floor that night I never felt the same.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next morning, I woke up as a different person. It was like I started living. My sleep the night before was different. When I visited my mom, she testified about the glow in my eyes. She has never seen me happy like this in many years.

At last, we found my estranged brother and his family.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people are so angry with God that they won\'t give him full control of their lives. Some have watched their close ones died and this made them to doubt whether this God could be so loving. Some people watched others groan in pains and wallow in suffering and cause them to doubt the existence of God and If truly he lives up there, he lives far away.

It is good to let him know how you feel, King Hezekiah reminded him of how he served him. David in psalms always tell him, God this is how I feel....this and that.... also so many others in the bible and God comforted them all. God loves a broken spirit, someone who is will humbly come to his presence. It is about time you let him in your life and let him prove himself God again. Then you will see how Mighty he is in unsearchable ways. Ever loving and caring God. Humble yourself before him for he cares for you.&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15446019053970400FB_IMG_15430677662312363.jpg', '15371875057edl8i07ap4a99f7oo99m', '08:05:05', '2018-12-12', '1544601905i1aekle9r74rn90c44bto3', 1, 'thumb/15446019052470448FB_IMG_15430677662312363.jpg', 0, NULL, NULL),
(138, 'BROKEN', 'Ifedapomola Deborah', 'show', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BROKEN<br>&nbsp;It got to a point in your life where you stopped fighting with you and asked yourself why are you angry all this while. Well, it is not the same for everyone, but categorically for people who are egotistical, self-ambitious and selfish like me. Firstly, despite the fact that my Dad was a faithful servant of God he could not heal him and watched him died. He watched my mother suffered in the hands of my Dad\'s family who rendered us homeless. My mom would hawk vegetables just to feed her children. She would come back home tired, feeling body pain and her feet swollen from trekking and she would still fry akara till 10pm. Yet, my mother call on this God who allow us to go through this suffering. My brother was able to get a scholarship to study abroad. He didn\'t look back home. Still, she blessed God for this ungrateful son of hers. I watched my sister singing in choir, always full of happiness serving in the church. At a point, our pastor made reference to her saying \"ladies in church should emulate my sister\'s service toward God and people\". Despite all these, those so-called brothers ended up breaking her heart. At last, she got married. Five years after marriage, she was unable to have a child. Her husband sent her away yet, she remain faithful to Him.I vowed I won\'t end up in situation like theirs, so I brace myself up. I\'m not an atheist, I believe in God, many things in this world prove his existence. I just don\'t believe in resting all my hopes in him because he will always allow you to suffer yet those who don\'t believe in him flourish. So right from my childhood, I wasn\'t going to let anything back me down. I won the best graduating student in my set. I had the best WAEC result across the state. I entered University with two scholarship awards and I graduated as the overall best student. Currently, I\'m the branch manager of a bank. I had a flair for fashion, so I own a boutique that contains gorgeous designer dresses. I was able to bring out my mom out of penury. She lives in a good house and has her own car. I employed a driver and a maid for her. I had a wonderful boyfriend. I did all these without His help.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; After my usual visit to my mother on Saturday, she called me and said \"Omolara, I hope you acknowledge His Presence in your life\". This is not the first time she said it, she was not the first person to tell me this. But this time, I didn\'t argue. \"Alright\", I replied and left. I feel so empty. I don\'t even understand my life anymore. I wished I could call out to God for assistance. I needed peace but I just can\'t bring myself down to him. After all, I made it without Him and I thought I could go through this without him but I can\'t hold it any longer. I feel like committing suicide. Then my phone rang. It was my sister. She never left me alone. She was like an anchor. I don\'t understand how she remain happy without husband yet her mates are having kids. I was actually waiting for the day she would get married before I say \"yes\" to any man. At least, that\'s what I can do for her despite all what she has done for me. She noticed I was crying over the phone, \"Lara mi, what happened? Why are you crying? What happened between you and Bode?\" Before I could give her an answer, it was a total blackout.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; I woke up next morning seeing two people beside me. I couldn\'t recognize them at first until my sister spoke. \"She\'s awake\". \"Praise God, How are you doing?\" the man asked. My sister assisted me to sit up and rest on the pillow. \"I\'m feeling better, what happened?\" I asked them. \"You ran into a pole while driving and Olaoluwa\" &nbsp;pointing to the man beside her \"save your life and called me afterwards\" she explained. \"Thank you very much sir\". I said. Luckily, Olaoluwa was my sister\'s friend while they were in university. I pleaded with My sister not to tell my mother what happened. Olaoluwa and my sister never left my side throughout my stay in the hospital. My boyfriend was around too. I got to know Olaoluwa better, he is very nice man.

So I ask the question, success in life, is it by hardwork, by luck, fate or God want it to be? &nbsp;Someone said if we calculate our success by how hard we work then the man with the bricklaying job should be the richest. But that is not the case. I\'ve heard people saying, \"I just did it\" and they excel and I have seen people who told me how hard they work before they became successful. While there are people who really worked hard and yet the result isn\'t visible and seem as if they are not doing it at all.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked around and question life itself, is it by how hard we work? Do you think it is just by luck or destiny had made some to be successful and others the way round? or is it God who control some to be and others not to, for those that believe in existence of God over situations?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I concluded, like what the great book have said \"whatever your hands findeth to do, do it well\". I mean the good thing you are doing actually. Who knows maybe this is your chance or maybe destiny is pushing you to the path you are threading or God, the controller of everything is telling you, this is the way. &nbsp;But one thing I know for sure is for you to *WORK*. whether it is hard or not who knows what the next second, minute, hour, day may look like.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RAHFEY&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15446045676021170black-woman-thinking-vector-3792671.jpg', '15371875057edl8i07ap4a99f7oo99m', '08:49:28', '2018-12-12', '15446045682r273ete4i1toinafel34ccr5l3', 1, 'thumb/15446045675132129black-woman-thinking-vector-3792671.jpg', 1, 418, NULL),

Toke was a guy I knew back then. I don\'t want to remember how we met because it makes my heart to bleed the more. He is most handsome man I have ever seen. He was my everything and my life. I\'m incomplete without him. Life was beautiful and the sun was shining brighter everyday. Am I actually exaggerating? No, this is how you feel when you are in love. The reality set in when I understood that Toke want nothing from me except \"fun\". I\'m a lovely lady any man could fall in love with me. Different from other girls you\'ve met. Ambitious and self independent. In short, a wife material. I think that what is needed in a relationship. Toke love this about me but wanted something more. How did you expect me to stay with one woman all my life? I\'m just 27. My friends have more. I want to explore the earth, my dream and women too. How am I so sure you don\'t have other guys running around you too? He said. But he also added; Laide, you my best girl and I love you but I don\'t want to see any man around you. I am the only one here free to have countless girlfriends why? because I\'m a man. So I obeyed him. I love you Toke with all my heart but he keeps breaking my heart. And every time he is saying sorry even on his knees with tears in his eyes. You don\'t know how much you mean to me. I love you Laide but yet he keeps hurting me. We\'ve been together for 8years no sign he will be proposing to me. I don\'t even know if I really mean much to him like he claimed. Toke, please don\'t be scared to break my heart.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know we\'ve been together for so long. In good times and in bad times. In rain and in sunshine. I know your deepest secrets and you have wept on my shoulders. I have mine with you too, remember? I know you are my first and I\'m not mad at you. I washed your clothes and fetched your water and you called me \"Your second mother\". I stood by you when you were sick and I couldn\'t stop praying when things are not fine. Toke, don\'t be scared to hurt me because now you have done worst.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I appreciate those times you spend your last dime on me. I appreciate your calls and the lovely messages. Is it the surprise birthday party? Or the clothes you bought for me? Is it when you will stick with me when my mother was sick. I remembered when I slept in your sweater during those cold night. You couldn\'t sleep when I\'m sick. You travelled all the way from home to see me. Days when you bought my makeups and took me to a fancy restaurant. You even took responsibility of my siblings yet I cheated on you. It wasn\'t intentional. I told you how sorry I am and you forgave me but since then your countenance has change towards me. Yet you claim to love me but you were not doing like you used to. You find it hard to believe I\'m a changed person. You repay me even more than I do to you. Toke, please don\'t be scared to tell me it\'s over. Break my heart please, I\'ve learnt my lesson.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have done worst for you Toke. I was like your shadow. I don\'t mean to be proud but I did more for you. Remember when I gave you my school fees to pay for your project and lied to my dad that it was stolen. The apartment we lived back then in school you know I paid the rent for good four years. Most of your designer clothes I bought it. I gave you money whenever you needed it and help you when you have problems with your courses. I did it all because I was in love with you and you think I am a fool. My friends think I\'m under your spell, I did it out of love Toke. But Is that why you are scared to tell me you are fed up, You are seeing another woman. I\'m hurt Toke, please break up with me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are a drug addict, you drink to stupor. Yet I still love you. You are an amazing man, people just don\'t realize it. Sometimes I told you how bad smoking but you won\'t listen. The first time you hit me, you pleaded it was &nbsp;out of anger. But now even before an argument speed up between us you have turned me into a punching bag. I do lie to my friends that I had an accident and sometimes I told them I fell down, but how many times will I tell them those were not lies? Now I have turned into an object of mockery just because I\'m in love with you. Seriously, don\'t be scared to break my heart. Your beatings have done worst.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I want to remain a virgin till I married. I tried to explain to you but you don\'t understand. You accused me of being childish, not exposed and immature. You claim to love me yet you sleep around with other women. When I confronted you, you said that\'s what other women do to save their relationship. I have a life ahead of me and I don\'t want to destroy it with just 5minutes of pleasure. Here I am Olamitoke, break my heart. Tumininu, made that decision too but she so much love Oladele.

I am not much of talker as I get easily intimidated. I was only able to make three friends, one is late and the remaining two have distance themselves from me lately.</p><p><br>My dad left us when I was four and the next time I saw him was when I lost my twin brother, then I was five. I can\'t really remember much about my dad because even when we had him, I never felt like I had a father, he distanced himself but one thing I can never forget was the way he looks at us. I can\'t really say why but whenever my dad takes a look at my twin and I, I could see it in his eyes that he hates us and the news of my brother\'s death was like a thing of joy to him, I remember I overheard him telling my mum, \"<i>at least one of them doesn\'t have to worry about the truth</i>\", the meaning of this statement became much clearer as I grew older.</p><p><br>After my dad left us, mum became a wrecking ball as she gradually drowns herself in self-pity, alcohol, hard substances and home service sex.&nbsp; To be honest at times I don\'t blame my mum for the way things turned out because when my dad left us he left us with nothing, three months after he left we were evicted from the house we thought my dad had bought and this was the beginning of my misfortune.&nbsp;</p><p><br>We relocated to <strong>Festac</strong> and my mum literally stopped caring about my well-being though not immediately, I mean I have to give her credits, at first she did what she could to make us survive. I stayed at home all the time when we first got to Festac as my twin and my mum will go look for how to make ends means and it was during this period that we lost my twin, he was involved in a hit and run.</p><p>I didn\'t say my first set of words till when my twin brother died and just in case you wondering yes we were identical. It was assumed I was dumb, I couldn\'t speak so I learnt how to write fast and that won\'t have been possible if not for my mum\'s friend aunt <strong>Florence</strong>, she really helped on how to communicate, she even taught me some sign languages.&nbsp;</p><p><br>My love for music came as a result of a portable CD player I found when we were packing to Festac, mum said it belongs to dad, this CD player was my best friend as I had no friends and wasn\'t steady with my speech. So when I feel lonely I just listen to&nbsp;<strong>Bob Marley</strong>\'s CD album over and over again.</p><p>There are times I wish my twin was alive maybe life would have been easier for me, maybe I won\'t have gone through some of the depressing things I went through, maybe I won\'t have done what I eventually did. There are also times I blame my twin for everything that happen to my mum, if only he had not die, my mum probably won\'t have fallen off the wagon but life is cruel, it doesn\'t give you much and it takes everything from&nbsp; you, a lesson I learnt when I was seven&nbsp; years old.</p><p>So there you have it, that\'s everything you need to know about me, oh wait I forgot to add that I didn\'t attend nursery school, I started my education from primary one, aunt Florence was a school teacher, she was the one that helped me with the basic learning while I was also learning how to formulate my words better. Aunt Florence was fond of me for many reasons and one of them was my ability to learn quickly. I am not like every other kid, I don\'t have a best food as I eat what I see, and there are even times I have nothing to eat aside to drink water to fill up my belly.</p><p>So yes there it is, everything about myself I think you need to know, any other thing I recollect I will write down but for now that is all about Benson Afolabi Richard.</p>', 'uploads/15447966164530073IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '14:10:16', '2018-12-14', '1544796616s3c0ee6119a4iltdu3ri7c9i', 1, 'thumb/15447966163685328IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 662, NULL),

I attended Festac Primary School and the moment I stepped into the school compound and I saw students on the assembly ground, I wanted to go back home. I was scared, I have never been around many kids but my mum held my hands and told me everything would be fine.</p><p>Everything was indeed fine, I mean I won\'t be the first primary school kid to be stabbed in Festac, at the age of 10, I was already an adult with my reasoning, while my mum was getting drown in being a single mum, the street of Festac raised me. I saw and learnt things a young boy shouldn\'t be learning even in the next generation. My mum, sorry this page is still about me, so I will get back to my mum.</p><p>Remember I said something about being smart, yes I was smart<i>. Na my smartness no make popo catch me when them carry Iwge for Cocaine Avenue, na this same brain I use escape catch fire for Festac College and na this same brain I use do wetin I do</i>.</p><p>My last birthday was the 6th year of me seeing a therapist and mum doesn\'t even have a clue. At age 11 I had my second depression and this was because I couldnâ€™t deal with the abuse from aunt Florence anymore, another thing my mum doesn\'t know, the only way I could deal with it was to leave Festac. Two years after I left Festac, <strong>Ehis</strong> was buried, Ehis was that every parent kind of son, he was strong enough not to allow the street life distract him, still he was killed for being Ehis, if Ehis had lasted this long, I am sure he would have found a way to talk me of out this, he always knew what to say to me and that I envy a lot because he had the kind of family I wanted.</p><p>Ehis was my best friend, his death really broke my heart, it made me begin to wonder, what you can do for life to actually be fair to you. Up to this very moment I always wish I could have traded my life for Ehis, I wish my mistake didn\'t affect him, when I heard how Ehis died, I knew it was my&nbsp; doing. I told him a secret I wasn\'t supposed to and just like he promised, he took that secret to his grave, literally speaking.</p><p>I took a big risk when I wanted to leave Festac, the outcome is only known to Ehis and I, and I am also taking the outcome to my grave. My therapist said the only true way for me to honour Ehis is by not giving up the secret he died for, that\'s why I am not going into details of that event. I really miss Ehis, I always carried the picture we took together during one of the first three birthday parties aunt Florence threw for me. As a matter of fact it was my sixth year birthday, I had a decent result in class and my speaking ability had improved though I was still very much shy. Still aunt&nbsp;Florence said my birthday is still worth celebrating, for someone that can\'t recollect any form of birthday celebration, my sixth birthday was one I held dear to my heart and it was also the beginning of me being used as a <i>sexual toy</i> or let me say, I became that kid <i>wey them they use suppress</i> <i>konji.</i></p><p>Yes I used the word â€œthemâ€ because aunt Florence had a friend, aunty <strong>Ada</strong>, she too took her chances whenever she was around. â€œ<i>I know everything about you and aunt&nbsp;Florence, if you don\'t do what she use to tell you to do with me, I will tell your mum</i>â€ these were the exact words she uses to tie my hands. At this point let me tell you a little about my mum\'s situation, three months after we got to Festac she started going out with <strong>Demola</strong>, she thought she was in love, I mean Demola was spending so who could blame her. But it was soon she found out that a Festac guy will do anything to get a lady to bed.&nbsp;</p><p>One month after <i>constant bedtime</i> with my mum, Demola tossed her side. My mum was heartbroken, she was a laughing stock on the street but aunt Florence was able to help her heal. She and my mum became close because she too was once played by Demola, so she understood what my mum was going through. Now as a kid of 6 years how exactly do you tell your mum that her best friend who by the way doesn\'t keep a boyfriend is using her son for sexual satisfaction?</p>', 'uploads/15447968594731197IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '14:14:20', '2018-12-14', '154479686039l8ase6icdiu3r48ic39et7', 1, 'thumb/15447968599654172IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 410, NULL),

She got a job as a club manager in one of the big hotels in Festac, the pay was good, at least we could have three square meals, I could pay my school fees and house rent wasn\'t an issue, my mum was happy her life was finally getting back together, the only thing that eluded her was love, not that I am trying to insult my mum but she was a sucker for love, few sweet words and she is head over heels for you. After her break up with Demola, aunty Florence introduced her to Daniel, Daniel showed my mum true love but all was just part of a big scam.&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel wasn\'t as rich as Demola, so most of the spending was done by my mum, something aunty Florence was against at some point then, you know what they say about love, it is blind for those who choose not to see, my mum wasn\'t ready to see. Aunty Florence didn\'t know much&nbsp; about Daniel, he was a friend of a friend, Daniel ran into aunty Florence and my mum at the club and after Daniel and aunty Florence did some catch up, he asked to be introduced to my mum and she did and that was how the relationship started.&nbsp;</p><p>There were nights where the club was filled up that aunty Florence and I would at times give my mum a hand and when Daniel came into the picture, he will help too. There was this night the club was very busy, as the ballers of Festac came to ball, my mum needed all the help she could get but that very day I was ill and aunty Florence had to stay with me at the hospital, my mum had to turn to Daniel to help her out which he did. Sales was at it\'s peek, that around 4am when things had ease, my mum and Daniel decided to have a drink in her office to celebrate the sales because that much sales means my mum was going to get a bonus pay. According to what my mum said, it was her idea that they have a drink together but things got really out of hand that my mum got drunk and eventually slept off. She woke the next morning and Daniel was gone.</p><p>She said when she woke up and discovered that Daniel had left the club, the first thing she did was to call him to know where he was but his number wasn\'t going through. She said it was after this she decided to do a proper account of the money they made the previous night, she screamed like a mad woman when she realized that the money which was up to a million plus was gone and the only person that saw where she kept the money was also gone. She said she sat down there crying because it was at this point she realize she didn\'t know where Daniel lives, she kept on calling the number but the number didn\'t go through. She sat down there crying till the owner of the club came, she was arrested, beaten and after three months in prison she was let go when it became obvious that she really didn\'t know anything about how the money went missing, that was the last time she saw Daniel.&nbsp;</p><p>This incident was the wrecking ball incident for my mum because after this, she literally didn\'t care much again, all she wanted to do was to keep drinking, aunty Florence would prevent her at times and at times they will both get drunk and say all sorts of rubbish talk forgetting that I am in the house. It was during this their drunkenness talk I knew that aunty Florence had not had a relationship in three years and she was a pimp, not sure if a woman is called a pimp but I am sure you get what I am trying to say. My mum begged her to find her one rich guy that can take care of her needs or make her one of her runs girl but she turned my mum down, saying she can\'t do that for her. At times I wonder what if she had said yes, what if my mum had gotten that sugar daddy maybe she won\'t have gone down the path she did.</p>', 'uploads/15447970129958569IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '14:16:52', '2018-12-14', '1544797012lcdi6re4421uatc9i0e13si2', 1, 'thumb/15447970122445141IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 490, NULL),

I wonder what if she had not met Daniel probably my life won\'t have turned this way, if my mum wasn\'t always getting drunk almost every night, I am sure I would have told her that I was abused sexually though back then I didn\'t know what I would have called it but at least I would have been able to tell her what aunty Florence and her friend were doing to me.</p><p>If you are reading this, I want you to picture how much mess it was for a child to literally witness different men sleeping with with his mother almost every night. I know this might sound funny but if there is one thing I can\'t get out of my head, it is the way my mum\'s b00bs bounces up and down when she bends down for one of those men to ride her from behind. After my mum got back from jail, she almost took her life if not for aunty Florence who stopped her that night I might have been a complete orphan by now. There are times I think about that too, maybe I would have been better off if she had just killed herself at least I won\'t have to watch her destroy herself.</p><p>Before I stop talking about my mum, let me just say that she got help, she got better, at least the last time I saw her she was looking healthy. Mummy if you are reading this, it means it\'s too late to help me, I want you to know that I do love you and I don\'t blame you for how my life turned out, I guess I was also messed up in my own way. I also want you to forgive aunty Florence in as much as she was using me as her pleasure object she had some positive impact in my life. Remember the scholarship I won that you said I couldn\'t go because you couldn\'t let your only child out of your sight, she was the one that stayed with me all through the night to make sure I studied hard and of course without her, I am not sure my speech would have been this perfect, so please mum find it in your heart to forgive her.</p><p>The first time aunty Florence made me touch&nbsp; her was the day I went to her house, I had just returned from school and I needed to do some homework, usually she would have been in my house but since I didn\'t meet her I decided to go look for her. She invited me to her room, took a look at my homework and she put me through, then I went to the sitting room to continue with it. After I was done I went back to the room to show her so that he could cross check like she does, I got into the room and I met her almost naked on the bed, I quickly ran out of the room apologizing as I did, she used her towel to cover herself and came to the sitting room. When I saw her I was scared to death as I started to apologize, <i>â€œI am sorry, I didn\'t know, aunty Florence I am sorryâ€</i> I said continuously but she just stood there looking at me smiling. After a while she said \"leave your assignment and follow me to the roomâ€, to be honest I started crying because I felt I was in for it and the fact that she didn\'t even say a word after that just made my tears and begging much louder.&nbsp;</p><p>As we got to the room, she sat on the bed and told me to move closer to her and as I did, she told me to stop crying, she said she knew I didn\'t come in on purpose, so I should stop crying. She wiped my tears as I comported myself, she then asked me what part of her body I saw, at first I said I didn\'t see anything but she touched my head saying she wasn\'t going to beat me that I should just tell her the truth. I told her I said I saw a quick flash of her b00bs, she smiled for a while and that left me confused, in my mind I was thinking what was making her smile but I got more confused when she said \"will you like to see it fully?â€. My throat became dry, words weren\'t coming out from my mouth and for the first time in a long while, I lost my voice. While I was still struggling to gather words out of my mouth she took my hands and placed it on her \'oranges\' and said \"don\'t be shy, you can touch itâ€ then she left my hand on it. Like a stature my hands just remained there as I didn\'t even know what to say or how to act, I eventually took my hands off her and said \"I am sorryâ€. She smiled as she ask me what I was sorry for, before I could say anything she took off her towel and said â€œI want you to touch itâ€, I didn\'t know when I urinated on my body.</p>', 'uploads/15448650973905907IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '09:11:37', '2018-12-15', '15448650973a4e6i0594u2i2trccies8dl', 1, 'thumb/1544865097274588IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 546, NULL),
(147, 'Suicide Note (Page Five)', 'Abdulhafeez Onitilo', 'show', '<p>From pressing her b00bs, I moved to sucking it and after a while she told me to start touching her privates. I know this will sound silly, there are times I actually enjoyed touching her, I mean I get this sensationally feeling that just makes my body feel unnecessarily good. It was obvious she was enjoying whatever it was I was doing to her, though I couldn\'t understand if it was my own touch that made her scream or it was the way she was dipping her fingers into her privates.&nbsp;</p><p>From the day she first made me touch her, I never did my homework in my house anymore, once I came back from school, I will go to her house with my homework as that was what she said. I know you might be wondering why I didn\'t look for someone else to help me out but that is even a different story all together. Because of my inability to speak fluently, I didn\'t make many friends in Festac aside Ehis and because of my mum\'s history with guys, I hated the guys on my street. So I was stuck with Aunty Florence and like I said, she wasn\'t all that bad as it wasn\'t every time I go to her place that she would ask me to touch her, there are days where she would even beat me if I mess up with my assignment.</p><p>I guess me helping her satisfy whatever urge she was feeling was just about the only bad attitude she has that I know of, aside from that she was very disciplined, if you see the way she talks to my mum, you might think she gave birth to my mum. I remember one night I cried to her house because I was very hungry and my mum had passed out wasted, she feed me and made me sleep at her place, the next morning when we got to our place, she blasted my mum, my mum started to cry that day, my mum later apologized to me.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I forget, let me quickly say that I didn\'t stay long in school, the last time I went to school was a week before my mum got arrested and throughout her stay in prison I didn\'t attend school though aunty Florence told me to go school but I couldn\'t, I couldn\'t even walk on the street during the day as I was ashamed of the way people were looking at me and even the names some of them call me got me crying at times. Aunty Florence wasn\'t really around during that period she said she had some things she had to take care of. Whenever she was around she will come over to our house to take care of me but when she wasn\'t around I was lived on my own and this was how I started getting familiar with Festac street life.&nbsp;</p><p>When I get bored, I go to 5th avenue which is far from my street to play football, I enjoyed playing football. At 5th avenue nobody knew me or my mum, so I didn\'t have to hide my face, though I wasn\'t really vocal when I am with some of the street boys but I get to speak when necessary. I remember meeting this bros in 5th avenue, bros Chima. Bros Chima liked girls a lot, that is another thing about Festac I didn\'t mention, every Festac child grows up doing three things: Music, Womanizing or becomes a chronicle smoker, as for bros Chima, it was the ladies and a bit of smoking. Bros Chima liked me because I was very quiet and intelligent, he became my street brother, I remember when I started going to 5th avenue, I wasn\'t always picked to play football so most times I just watch and go home.&nbsp;</p><p>One day bros Chima who was one of the bros that were placing bet on those playing called me up, he asked if I was new to the street and asked why I was always around if I couldn\'t play football, I told him I wasn\'t from the street and that most times when they get to select players I don\'t get picked. He told me to come on time the next day as he promised me I will get the chance to be picked and just like he promised the next day I came, I played and that was how I started rolling with him, days that I don\'t feel like playing he would invite me to join him and his friends in his house, it was from him and his friends I learnt how to play card and I had my first hard drink with him too.&nbsp;There is this game called â€œstripâ€, this is where whoever loses a game of card will be told to take off a clothing item and I have witnessed some girls strip to their panties alone. Once it gets to that level bros Chima will ask me to go home and come back the next day. Even though I was always shy he was the one that taught me how to approach a girl because most times he will always send me to help him go met a girl.&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15448653025880965IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '09:15:02', '2018-12-15', '15448653023u236le0r0iasi6d8ti74cce', 1, 'thumb/15448653024780892IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 525, NULL),

He always looked out for me, he thought me how to be tough in his own possible way. In 5th avenue I was like a prince, I could move around and do whatever I like, the streets of 5th avenue was my safe haven.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time it was on this street I was first chased by police men. It was on this same street I witness robbers killing someone in cold blood. I can\'t forget that evening, I was cold all through the night. It was some few minutes to seven, I can remember vividly because I had just finish playing ball and was heading to bros Chima\'s flat to wash my body and just stay there for a while. After washing my legs and face, bros Chima gave me money to go buy him beer and Garri (yellow Eba). I had bought it and I had ten Naira change so I decided to branch at a Mallam shop to buy biscuit for myself. It was at this Mallam shop I heard the shooting, I didn\'t know what it was, in my mind I thought it was \'banger\' only for me to see Adamu (the Mallam) closing his kiosk shouting \'danborobber\'. I turned back to face the street and till today what I saw still sends cold shiver down my spine. A man was lying on the floor in his own pool of blood as the thieves were speeding off in their car.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn\'t go back to 5th avenue for like a month, till today I can\'t even remember what happened to the Garri and beer I went to buy nor can I recollect how I got home, all I remember was seeing the blood and waking up the next day at home. Of course I still went back to 5th avenue but bros Chima and I weren\'t that close anymore, can\'t really say this was what happened, I just notice that one day I stopped going to his house and eventually I even stopped going to 5th avenue though I can remember the reason for that. There is this big sandy field in 5th avenue that is where the bros <i>dem dey play</i> football. On this unfortunate day, I decided to&nbsp; go to the field to watch them play ball, no, sorry I actually went to look for bros Chima, I was told that he had gone to play ball so my thought was that he went to the sandy field. On getting there and noticing he wasn\'t there, I decided to stay and watch the other bros playing, little did I know that I was going to get in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>The field has a fence around it, I was seated on the fence when I notice some activities going on opposite me. They were three bros sitting on a bench at the other end of the fence, my eyes caught them at first but I didn\'t pay attention but after a while when my eyes went towards that direction again I saw one man walk up to them, gave them money and in exchange they gave him a small black nylon. I couldn\'t say what was in the black nylon but my eyes followed the man whom by the way was putting on a nice <i>Agbada.</i></p><p>I saw the man get into his car, a BMW X5 Jeep and as I was taking my eyes back, my eyes came in contact with one of the bros sitting down and he gave me a signal to come over. Wetin small pikin like me know, I went over, he asked how many of my mate did I see on the field and that was when I realized I was the only kid on the field. I tried making up some excuse but he wasn\'t buying it as he kept tapping me on the head. He brought out another small nylon from one of the holes in the fence as someone else walked up to him. I didn\'t look at them as I took my face away but I heard him saying tell <i>chief this one strong pass the last one, na Italian coke be thisâ€</i>. I took a quick glance at the nylon wondering what type of coke could be in that small nylon. After the guy left, he asked me why I was looking at the man that left and what did I see, I told him I didn\'t see, I lied that the man looked like my Mum\'s friend that was why I was looking at him. He pulled my ear and said <i>I no won see you for here again, oya disappear</i>â€.&nbsp;</p><p>I disappeared and I went home, hours later I was playing on my street when I saw one of those bros with three other bros I can\'t recognize, as they sighted me, he shouted \'na the boy be thatâ€, that was how I started running as I saw them running towards me. As I was running I was thinking, what in the hell did I do?, they caught up with me and before I could say <i>Jack Robinson</i> they started pounding me saying <i>na you go jabo abi</i>â€. After beating me for like three minutes, they calmed to ask if I was the one that told the police that <i>Catch Fire</i> was selling drugs at the field. I was very much confused because I didn\'t see them with any drug, I told them no, I didn\'t speak to any police neither did I see them selling any drug. Then one of them slapped me again and said <i>so you won talk say you no see us they sell white coke today?</i>â€. I was shocked, of course as a Festac boy I have heard of it but when Catch Fire mentioned Italian coke my brain didn\'t think towards that.</p>', 'uploads/15448656295872880IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '09:20:30', '2018-12-15', '15448656308u7ta2cr2ld9i99es50ei1ci', 1, 'thumb/15448656291035548IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 624, NULL),
(150, 'BE YOU', 'Ifedapomola Deborah', 'show', '<p>I was still thinking about it, until Sister Linda Ikeji case came up.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A friend of mine, Dami, he said Ifedapo, I love the way you write, I\'m sure you must be a strong, super woman. In my mind, I laughed and was like only if you know how weak I can be. Sometimes I even act like a child, you\'ve not witnessed me weeping. You don\'t know days when I feel like not praying, not even reading my bible. Even to carry my notes or books to read is problem for me. Someone would see and be like spiritual mama, I\'m telling you I still look up to people and feel like baby christian. Sometimes, when I\'m praying for people, I\'m wishing someone too is praying for me out there too? I\'m responsible for people but I will ask myself is there someone out there looking out for me? I care for people but sometimes, I want to be careful for. I\'m sure same thing happens to several people who God has placed in one position or the other, that people look up them. But in this part of the world we are in, they see these people as demigod, they expect you to be perfect, no sign of weakness and if you do otherwise, then your are hypocrite, pretender, or you are probably seeking for attention. These have definitely caused problems in the lives of several celebrities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; One thing I always do before writing is directing that situation to myself, what if you are in that position, what will do? If this was written about you, how will you feel? So when I write, I don\'t always write for people alone, I write for myself also. So atimes when I go back to what I\'ve written, I\'m always amazed and I have benefited from what I wrote myself.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I\'m going to address three situations here. Firstly, because you are in a particular position doesn\'t mean you can\'t make mistakes, as long as we are human, we are prone to it. Situations or people may warrant them to do so. Some might not even know they are doing the wrong thing and some, I won\'t lie to you, they are just seeking attention, they just have evil motives. But one thing I always love is for one to admit that he or she is wrong and learn from that mistake, or else you will make yourself a liar and lose your integrity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secondly, before you remove the log in someone\'s eye, remove the speck in yours first. Don\'t say it because that\'s what they are saying, don\'t write because that is what you are expected to write. Don\'t say or write what you don\'t practice. Don\'t think if I say, do or write this, they will love you more. People are watching in case you don\'t know, you might think they are not looking and it won\'t be nice if they didn\'t speak well of you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lastly, people can be so funny at times when used them to measure on how well you are doing, Right from when I was kid, all the uncles and aunts in the neighborhood would say; \"you should go to Art class, you write very well\". Some would say \"I\'m touched\". Another person would walk up to me and say \"I love the way you write, can you write something for me?\" Another one would say, \"let\'s write something together\". Another one will ask you for your advice. Another will even ask you \"when are you writing the next episode?\" You know when they give you more attention. So they expect you to give them more and more, you wouldn\'t want to disappoint them. Somehow, you get used to it and when you couldn\'t keep up, you had to do something forgetting that these same people are the one who will point fingers at you. What am I saying in essence is be yourself and don\'t exaggerate things, don\'t be afraid to say you can\'t keep up. Don\'t let your happiness depends on people or to please them yet don\'t let it be about you alone... you are becoming selfish in nature. Just be you.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Photo: One of the \'lazy me\' picture&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15448841386086341IMG_20181209_161032.jpg', '15371875057edl8i07ap4a99f7oo99m', '14:28:58', '2018-12-15', '1544884138bet50r9ali8e6c97317', 1, 'thumb/15448841386150165IMG_20181209_161032.jpg', 1, 623, NULL),

I literally lost a tooth and I had to lie to aunt Florence that I injured myself playing football, I couldn\'t bring myself to tell her the truth, how could I?, knowing what awaits me if I do, that was the last time I ever went to 5th avenue.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Okay if you are reading this, let me quickly say this, everything you have been reading is because my therapist believes that writing down what I have gone through will help me move forward in terms of dealing with it. I met my therapist few months after I left Festac and I have to say meeting her has been a blessing so far, she has done a good job making sure I get myself together. I remember when I met her, my life was really messed up, I was sleeping under different bridges, eating from different dumpsite and at times <i>na market I go go steal wetin to chop</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>Na wetin I wan chop I go steal for market</i> the day I met my therapist, I thought I had successfully stolen bread off this woman\'s kiosk only for me to hear the daughter of the woman shouting <i>â€œole ole ole\"</i> and before I knew what\'s up market people began to chase me, I am a lazy runner but that doesn\'t stop me from running and like always I was caught. You know what they say about stealing in the market, <i>sharp sharp</i>, tyre was already hanging around my neck and I could feel the taste of petrol in my mouth, the jungle justice was about to be carried out.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>\'Please please stop it, stop it, make una no kill am\',</i> these were the first sets of words I heard my therapist say. She literally saved my life that day or let me say she has being saving my life since that day. She took me to her house, changed my clothes then she fixed me something to eat. From the way I was eating she could tell I was very much hungry that she didn\'t even ask, she just went to get me more rice, after eating she then asked me what my name was. From the market till the moment I finished eating she didn\'t say a word aside asking if I was okay as we left the market.&nbsp;<br><br>I told her my name is Benson Afolabi Richard, lied to her about where I stay but told her the truth about everything else. I have to say at first I thought this woman was using jazz because I haven\'t been that free with anyone in my life the way I was with her in terms of speaking. Even aunt Florence that thought me how to speak, I only spoke with her when necessary but with her, from the moment she asked for my name, I just opened my mouth like tap water and I started talking.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It took me a while to understand that therapists have way of making you talk, though I have to say that\'s one hell of job, how can you just sit down and listen to people talk and complain all day, I would have been dead if I have to listen to my problem. When I told my therapist what I had gone through and what I am going through, she was fascinated, she couldn\'t believe how I was still able to put it together, she told me that at the point when we met I was going through depression (at first I thought that was like common disease) and also mentioned that based on what I have told her, that this will be the second time, she said she is afraid that if I continue this way I might not be able to make it to my next birthday.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Well I have tried, I have come a long way since then, soon enough I will be eighteen though the guarantee that I will live to see that day is slim, I have done something very bad and it has to do with my father, the same father I told you abandoned me and my mum.

As I saw him walk up to me to place his order, I started to remember everything he did to us while growing up and everything my mum had been through since he left and I wanted to do right there was to just ask him <i>why, why did he have to leave us?, why didn\'t he even bother to check on me?, why was he so relieved after the death of my twin?</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I got my answers eventually but it wasn\'t in the way you would have expected.&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15459990259673082IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '12:10:26', '2018-12-28', '1545999026ed2l1iaci28t9ecr4s22u51i', 1, 'thumb/15459990259066589IMG_20180226_225636_584.JPG', 1, 595, NULL),

The degrading situation and progress of the state is of ratio 1 to 80. It is like trying to quench a blazing fire with irregular drops of water. So disheartening to know, the proportion of economic decadence is enormously gigantic compared to the rate of development in the state. It is clear, the governments have been sailing the ship of the state without any map. The state government workers have lost the proper touch of a good directive from competent leaders. Sadly, the state lay bare just like a desert where nothing is happening. But another bitter truth is that something is happening. What? The position of the state has shifted from the fountain of knowledge to the bedrock of online scammersâ€•\'yahoo yahoo\'s domain. Houses and lands are rented and sold to them, goods are bought by them, eateries, clubhouses and hotels are patronised by them, even fuel at refilling stations are bought by them at about the same range as commercial drivers. In essence, &nbsp;the legal economy of the state is abjectly stuck and is sustained illegally by the hijacked dollars of â€˜yahoo boysâ€™. Kudos that the entire state is not unaware of this fact! So what has been done to this menace? Absolute nothing! Except that the statesmen and elders of the state due to their failed insight to stir the course of the state rightly have lost the confidence of ridding the state off of the appalling reign of â€˜yahoo boysâ€™. But what are the implications? It means the reign of illegal and embarrassing business â€˜Yahoo Yahooâ€™ has come to stay. It means that some days, â€˜Yahoo Boysâ€™ would by the economic input in the state contest and they might win. And then, the state is in smooth pepper soup!<br>My question is: how did the state get here in the first place? One can say it a million times that many factors have led the state to this economy end zone. Although the state has spent so many years arguing about which end of the egg is to be broken: the smaller end or the bigger end. Well, that factor has been the problem of Nigeria and not Ekiti alone. Primarily and basically, apart from the fact that the state allocation is meagre, all the tiers of government and the citizens have driven the state to its present economy end zone. They have done this through several factors, viz: headstrong factor, self-indiscipline factor, unneeded project factor, misplacement of priorities factor, lack of insight factor, greed factor, I-know best factor, insincerity factor, consumer-mentality factor and so on. The most painful is that, external people hold the state to high esteem while within, the state knows that those comments of fame are actually laurels of shame.<br>To bail Ekiti out, why donâ€™t the statesmen first push aside the insincere propaganda game and blame game they are good at, and just find their way to the drawing board? Why donâ€™t the state continue with their different political parties yet have and focus on one goal? A goal of investing in the health sector. The goal is called Project Classic Health. Why health? Because people cannot deny the fact that the economic value of health investment still hold sway today. Every class of humans want good health and they can go to the moon for it. But why Project Classic Health? It is simple, the absence of Project Classic Health made a sitting president in Nigerian to die in office and the presence of Project Classic Health made a sitting president in Nigeria to leave office to London for over 90 days. And when he returned, rumour has it that he has been cloned. What exactly is behind that drama and rumour of the presidentâ€™s health is the power of a Project Classic Health. Project Classic Health is possible in Ekiti State. In short, it has started privately in Ekiti State at Afe Babalola University. However, that it has started in Ekiti does not mean the state does not need another Project Classic Health to increase the internal revenue, boost the economy of the state, and like, India, Germany UK, become the main hub of medical health solution in Nigeria and Africa at large.<br>It sounds insane, but it is like imagining a situation where all class of the human society who need superb healthcare and can afford it in the world are booking their tickets to Ekiti State. This image is amazing! It is a dream that can be realised. Although the Project Classic Health investment cannot happen in 4years or &nbsp;8 years, this is where the need of one economic goal by different political parties should come in. If it does, then in 16 to 32 years, Project Classic Health will be set in Ekiti. Certainly, 16 to 32 years is quite far, but that might be if we do not believe that time flies. More so, we are not going to grow old, die and leave Ekiti like that. We are going to bear children who will stay. Candidly, there has not been any long-term economic project in Ekiti State that the present thirties and forties can thank their grandfathers for in Ekiti. No wonder â€˜Yahoo Yahooâ€™ is the order of the day. But with the commencement of Project Classic Health, the present generation can put a smile on the face of the future generation. &nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15461034333436502images.jpg', '7NEO0I762M15TI661HLI', '17:10:33', '2018-12-29', '1546103433t3k90162iea61eil8c6tir', 1, 'thumb/15461034332109391images.jpg', 1, 652, NULL),

The content of your heart determines your place in life. Learn to take the good with the bad cause. \"tough times don\'t last but tough people do\". So how tough are you? In life many people sight without insight, but no one will truly ever rule over the affairs of life without an insight. To be successful in life, don\'t give or take excuses. You will never change if you keep focusing on results, instead focus on change and you will get results. Learn to read and listen , \"Be slow to speak and quick to hear says the bible\". Don\'t be quick to judge and label stray/isolated situations in your life as failure. Its OK to fail, make mistakes, just don\'t get bedridden by it. Fall down seven(7) times, rise up eight(8). Someone once said, A life spent making mistake is not only honourable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing. The question remains, \"what are you doing? Be productive. &nbsp;If there is no *wind* just *ROW*<i> </i>life itself is a test. You never know how great you can, Never stop believing.persevere, Keep moving, No matter the pace, remember only by perseverance the snail reached the ark. Don\'t be mindful of the fact that many has gone ahead, it doesn\'t mean they are ahead of you. Some actually went much more earlier to spread palm fruit leaves for you to walk on. So don\'t give up until you\'ve made your last attempt and don\'t make your last attempt until you have succeeded.

I have a dream and am gonna do everything I can to make it happen. We all have over 86 thousand &nbsp;seconds a day. Use your Time wisely. What ever dream you have push yourself to make it into reality. If you doubt yourself you never gonna make it.

That\'s how my journey of living in hell begun, I followed routines daily, wake up by 5 am, leave the hostel by 6am so I can sit at the front, there are times when I leave the hostel by past 6 there wouldn\'t be where to sit, I will stand through a 2hours class, I was fed up but i kept on because I always remember this quote from my mother &nbsp;\"When the going gets tough, the tough get going\". I followed every rule, the same routine till the semester was over then it was time to check my result I had 7As, 2Bs I was happy, I thought maybe Eksu isn\'t that bad after all but it wasn\'t the same story in my second semester I read for this course more than anything I complained, you better thank God someone said, there was mass failure.

Nothing like having a good sexual intercourse after the whole messy day you have been through, right? The problem with this is the fact that you might not be at your best performance because of all the stress you been through during the day. And if probably you didn\'t stress yourself during the day, the anxiety that you would be getting laid at night might just be what would hinder your performance level and deprive you of the sexual satisfaction you need.</p><p>Midnight sex is fabulous because of the cool weather between the hours of 3am - 5am, this would make your sexual organ want to heat up which is a good mood setter but this would also lead to quick ejaculation. The performance level would begin to increase as the fiction between both organ begin to increase and once the homos as gotten the needed heat it begin to cool off which in most case we don\'t tend to know and this is when we ejaculate or climax quick.</p><p>It is very unusual to find people having sex around this time because they have to wake up early and prepare for work and on days whereby they are not going to work they prefer to use that time to get enough rest. Early morning sex between the hours of 6am - 8am is the best time to have that sexual pleasure you might be craving for because at this time your sexual organ are always ready for any sexual activities. Your testosterone and energy level are always higher during this period which is the best mood setter and if you can be patience and stay sensually focused then would you end up having the best sexual orgasms of your life.</p><p>So people try out some of my experiment to see if Iâ€™m wrong or right.</p>', 'uploads/15470281302078376Vaginal_sex_page.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '10:02:10', '2019-01-09', '1547028130e1lc40he14iw16na99r4t', 1, 'thumb/15470281306902628Vaginal_sex_page.jpg', 1, 572, NULL),

This now allows it to be possible for some enemy of democracy and legally-insufficient knowledgeable people to hijack the situation, twist it in their favour to poison people\'s mind with a clear attempt to spite the patience of democracy.</p><p>This is bad. I really sympathise about the coincidence that Justice Walter is from the south-south, that the federal election is close by, that the most senior judge after Justice Walter is a northerner, that most Nigerians aren\'t legally exposed, that PMB has been considered a dictator and a tribalist. I really sympathise a lot.</p><p>To me, I feel Justice Walter is the villain. He has made whatever plight against our democracy possible by what he simply calls \"forgetfulness\". He has added salt to the injury of our democracy by failing to do the needful when he was alleged: voluntarily stepping down as CJN, and he is breaking the Carmel\'s back of democracy by staying silent about the whole situation.</p><p>However, as much as I would refer my readers to the Nigerian constitution of section 231, subsection 4 et al, I would like to say expressively that that PMB hasn\'t breached the constitution as much as the way people say he has.

Truly the relationship was over but she wasn\'t sure if the passion between them was over, back then whenever she hears the voice of her ex, there was this sweet sensation that runs through her spine that makes her quiver and this is something she doesnâ€™t feel with <strong>Lekan</strong> unless she was been touched by him. It wasn\'t as if she wasn\'t enjoying the sex between her and Lekan, she did because it was a whole new experience for her but she felt there was something missing, something only her ex had given her, an orgasm that would paralyze her for about thirty seconds.</p><p>Due to the nature of Lekanâ€™s job, he had to travel a lot and that was something Nkechi was trying had to cope with even though whenever he is around he surely knows how to make it up to her yet she wasn\'t always happy whenever he wasn\'t around. Loneliness and boredom was what actually brought her and her ex together back then when she was schooling in Enugu but this is Lagos,&nbsp;<i>the city that never sleeps</i>, boredom wasn\'t a problem for her as she had exciting places she could go whenever her boyfriend wasn\'t around. She was always scared of been alone because she knows deep down in her heart that she might just head back to the lifestyle she and her ex were leaving, a lifestyle she wasn\'t even sure if she should let go off. She never thought that the love experience she had with her ex was going to be over immediately she left Enugu, she still had great feelings for her ex but once she came across Lekan she started to experience something new, something different from what she had with her ex and just like that she forgot the promise she made to her ex. â€œ<i>Don\'t worry as soon as I settle down in Lagos I would come visiting I promise</i>â€ she said to her ex on the day she left Enugu finally.</p><p>Lekan is a typical example of a Lagos&nbsp;<i>sharp guy</i>&nbsp;who grew up on the streets of Surulere, attended the school with the most bragging right â€œUnilagâ€. He works as a contract staff for a telecommunications company and this provides him with the kind of cash he needed to flirt around with girls. He actually met Nkechi at a park in Enugu when he was heading back to Lagos from a job trip, they got to talk and from there they became friends and months later they started dating. Nkechi became Lekan first serious girlfriend since he broke up with his ex, two years ago, after the break up, his relationship was more about flings and&nbsp;<i>fwb</i>&nbsp;till he came across Nkechi. Truly Nkechi is beautiful but what made him attracted to her was beyond her beauty, it was more of a love at first sight thing.</p><p>He was very helpful in helping Nkechi adjust to life in Lagos as he was the one that helped her secure a job and also found an apartment for her, something Nkechi said she would forever appreciate. Being the first guy she came across in Lagos and considering how helpful he had been, Nkechi felt very comfortable around him even before he asked her out. The day he asked her out she wasn\'t expecting it, it was on a weekend, he had just arrived from one of his trips and he asked her over. On getting to his house, he asked her if she could cook something for them to eat and that she did with all pleasure. In the middle of their meal while he was telling her about his trip, there was a sudden pause and after that pause followed this sentences â€œ<i>throughout my trip I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about you, couldnâ€™t stop thinking about how nice it would be to have you as my girlfriend, I mean, of course that if you are willing to</i>â€. Her reply was short and simple â€œ<i>I guess you would have to find out</i>â€.</p><p>She couldnâ€™t deny the fact that she was really enjoying this whole new love experience she had with Lekan. Her relationship with Lekan couldnâ€™t be compared with the one she had with her ex for so many reasons, part of it was the fact that she didn\'t have to hide her love for Lekan the way she did with her ex. She could show public affection for him something that would look extremely weird if she had done it with her ex though she and her stayed together while she was schooling but they only made people to believe that they were roomies. The only thing she could say she missed about her ex was the sexual pleasure&nbsp;<i>she&nbsp;</i>made her feel even though having sex with a man is a new experience which she is enjoying but deep down in her mind she knew it didn\'t match the ones she had with her ex.</p>', 'uploads/15487537381583878exes.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '09:22:18', '2019-01-29', '1548753738l61ser12i5aee9x9t984c', 1, 'thumb/15487537384266069exes.jpg', 1, 532, NULL),

She had tried to keep in touch with her but whenever she does Nkechi would always say she was busy and as time went on she assumed Nkechi wasn\'t just interested in her anymore so she let her be.</p><p>Her first&nbsp;relationshipwas short and not too interesting, she attended an all girlsâ€™ boarding school which exposed her to the&nbsp;lesbian<i> </i>world but as at then she never saw herself fitting into that world. She had this&nbsp;<i>bff&nbsp;</i>who by the way was already into lesbianism and that was how she was dragged into it. Although she was a lesbian while in secondary school she never had sex, though she had fantasize about it a lot but those fantasy didn\'t come to pass till she met Jenifer right after she left secondary school and it was Jenny (like she normally calls her) that took her virginity. After Jenny she had two other relationships one with a bisexual and the other a&nbsp;lesbian<i> </i>and it was after she broke up with the&nbsp;lesbian&nbsp;that she met Nkechi.</p><p>She had just resumed for her third year in school and it was at the point of registration she first saw Nkechi but they couldnâ€™t talk due to the whole stress of getting registered. The next time she saw her, it was at her faculty and this time they were able to talk, â€œ<i>wow, is that Take the Risk by Ben Carson</i>â€ she said as she took a seat beside Nkechi. â€œ<i>Yes it is</i>â€ Nkechi replied. â€œ<i>Wow! I canâ€™t believe it, I have been searching for this book, can you possibly lend me?&nbsp;</i>â€œ<i>Of course thatâ€™s when you are through with it</i>â€ she added when she noticed the expression Nkechi gave. â€œ<i>Well lending you isnâ€™t the issue but how do I get to see you when I am done with it</i>â€ Nkechi said. â€œ<i>Arenâ€™t you a member of this faculty</i>? She asked. â€œ<i>I am but I don\'t receive my lectures here, I only came here to finish up my registration</i>â€ Nkechi replied. â€œ<i>Then I guess I have to take your number so I can call you to know for sure, by the way you said you are here for your registration, may I ask what registration is that</i>? She said. â€œ<i>The one for the field trip and one other one like that</i>â€ Nkechi replied. â€œ<i>I guess today is your lucky day, I know the guy that is in charge of the registration, I can help you talk to him</i>â€ she said back. â€œ<i>I would be very glad, I have been here for three days now and I havenâ€™t been able to do anything</i>â€ she responded. â€œ<i>Alright then, follow me let go see him in his office</i>â€ she said. And that was how she and Nkechi became friends and from friends they became lovers something Nkechi didn\'t believe was going to happen.</p><p>Throughout her first and second year Nkechi was very serious with her studies, her schedule was from her hostel to school to tutorial back to the hostel and on weekends it was between tutorial and church. She didn\'t socialize that much, the only friends she had were those that stayed in the same hostel with her and they didn\'t even talk much but there was something about <strong>Seun </strong>that she likes, she was caring, understanding, lively and fun to be with. Typically when it comes to socialization Nkechi didn\'t know where to turn to and that was why she enjoyed the company of Seun. Whenever she felt bored she would call her to come over and they would gist from morning till night and this was how she got to know that Seun was a lesbian. After so many attempt of getting Nkechi a boyfriend had failed, Seun decided to make a move on her and her gambled paid off. â€œ<i>I know you are surprise that I agreed to date you because I told you I am not a lesbian which is true. But ever since I caught my elder sister with my cousin having sex together, I have secretly wished to experience what it felt like, I have read a lot of books and as shameful as it might sound I sometimes masturbates</i>â€. The first time they had sex Nkechi was blown away as she never knew that sex with a girl could be so pleasurable and breathtaking. â€œ<i>Wow if I knew this was how it feels I would have probably had sex a long time agoâ€</i>, Nkechi said right after she reached her first orgasm. â€œ<i>If you have never had sex before then who come disvirgin you</i>? Seun asked. â€œ<i>Like I said I masturbate a lot and it was during that process I disvirgin myself</i>â€ she replied. â€œ<i>Wow that must have been some pretty serious masturbation you did</i>â€ Seun said right before she placed a kiss on her lips as they enjoyed another round of sex.</p><p>It was when Seun moved over to Ibadan that she was able to get over Nkechi, the plan was to stay in Enugu, find a job and an apartment so whenever Nkechi was free she could always come over. Since Nkechi wasn\'t even forthcoming on her promises she decided to head back home and it was then she met her new love, though it wasn\'t the kind of relationship she would have love to have because the girl she met said she would only date her if she agrees that they would once in a while have sex with men. The relationship was more of a&nbsp;<i>when the desirable is not available the available becomes the desirable</i>&nbsp;kind of a thing, perhaps she thought to herself what harm would it do if she decide to have sex with a man. â€œ<i>I guess there is always a first time for everythingâ€,</i>&nbsp;Seun said when her new love gave her the condition.</p>', 'uploads/15487541156788800exes.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '09:28:35', '2019-01-29', '1548754115e0te4ca50733e2srix05l', 1, 'thumb/15487541159139694exes.jpg', 1, 542, NULL);

Lekan wasn\'t expecting her to come around that very day because he had told her that he wasn\'t going to be around but he had also forgotten that she had his spare key which means free entry whenever she feels like and on this faithful day she felt like.</p><p>Actually she came over to pick a material she needed for her project and since Lekan had told her he wasn\'t going to be around she didn\'t bother pressing the doorbell once she got to his door step. Truly Lekan had locked the door and based on the outside look you wouldnâ€™t believe someone was home considering how the windows were shut down but little did she know that Lekan was at home. Lekan was really carried away with the phone conversation he was having that he didn\'t hear the sound of the door when it opened, the door to his room was ajar and it was the sound that came from the room that caught her attention.</p><p>At first she thought probably Lekan forgot to switch off the television in his room so she decided to check it out but as she moved closer, things started to seem strange and the first thing that tipped her off was the door that was at ajar. Lekan never leaves his door open even when he is at home, so the fact that he wasn\'t home and the door was slightly opened made her feel suspicious. The sound that was coming from the room became louder as she got closer, it wasn\'t the sound of the television as she thought, it was a familiar sound, a sound she only hears whenever she and Lekan were having sex and that made her heart skip. â€œ<i>Oh my God, is that what I think its sound like</i>â€ she said to herself as she finally got close enough to the door to see what was happening. Her expectation was to catch Lekan in the act but that wasn\'t the case, Lekan was on the phone talking to someone and he was moaning and that was when it hit her that he was actually having sex with someone over the phone. This pissed her off for two reasons one; she could remember vividly this one time she asked Lekan if they could do such and he said never, two; he lied to her that he wasn\'t going to be around. After ten minutes of listening to their conversation and watching her beloved moan over the phone as he was masturbating, she busted into the room with all the anger she could gather. Lekan was really caught off guard and off balance as he didn\'t know what to say, he was far beyond short of word as he was clueless concerning what to say and when he finally spoke the only thing he could say was â€œ<i>Mercy itâ€™s not what you think it is</i>â€.</p><p>Lekan did try to make amend but the method he used didn\'t help the situation. â€œ<i>I swear you have to believe me, she is just a friend</i>â€ he said. â€œ<i>Oh I see, a friend that you can have phone sex with</i>â€ she replied back. â€œ<i>I only did it because I wanted to make her happy, trust me nothing more than that</i>â€. â€œ<i>Really, I caught you butt naked masturbating, I am sure there is more than enough to that</i>â€. â€œ<i>If you really wanted her to be that happy why didn\'t you just go over and have sex with her</i>? She added to her sentence. â€œ<i>That never going to happen</i>â€ he replied her immediately. â€œ<i>And why is that</i>? She asked. He had already said the answer before he realized how worst he just made the issue. â€œ<i>Oh so you mean if she was in the country you would have?</i> â€œ<i>Gosh all guys are the same</i>â€ she added to her statement before she walked out on him. â€œ<i>That wasn\'t what I meant</i>â€ he said as he tried holding her back to see if he could still savage the situation but from the way she acted he could tell it was too late. â€œ<i>Donâ€™t you dear touch me you this scumbag, as a matter of fact I don\'t want to ever hear my name from your mouth</i>â€ she said as she forcefully took her hands away from him and walked out of the house.</p><p>She had this interim program she applied for that was going to last for a year and her plan was to move into Lekanâ€™s house and stay with him for that one year but after the whole phone sex incident, she had to change her plan. The program was supposed to start three months after her graduation but she wasn\'t able to resume on time because she had issue with accommodation, since she had graduated there was no way the school could let her stay in the hostel. She made a friend who offered her to stay in her house for a while probably before she could get her own place but as time went on and she and this her friend became more close, her friend told her she could stay as long as she wanted.</p><p>She and her friend whom by the way also enrolled for the same program with her went out to party and unfortunately for them they were beaten by the rain on their way back. They were drunk and cold, they were also alone and before they could say Jack Robison they were caught up in the moment as they both kissed each other before they laid side by side fingering and sucking each other. The next morning after they were back to their senses, they decided it would be best for them not to talk about what happened the previous night and they should just move on with their lives. â€œ</p><p><i>it was just a moment of highness nothing more perhaps you have a boyfriend and I am not a lesbian so just like you said we are not going to talk about this again</i>â€ Mercy said&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15487544455728826exes.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '09:34:05', '2019-01-29', '1548754445tl69a03secx5i8r749ee1', 1, 'thumb/15487544455783266exes.jpg', 1, 590, NULL),

Today was a weekend which means no lectures I was Bored. Staying in a hostel far to school makes it more difficult to make friends, I picked up my phone and turned off the music, It was time to go on social media and check up on my friends. I was sending a random Hello to everyone I saw online and waiting for anyone to Reply to me. &nbsp;â€œHi, girlâ€ a message popped up on my phone. It was from Tayo aka â€œMr too knowâ€ my Coursemate. He is known for asking too many questions in class hence the name â€œMr To knowâ€. Is there an assignment I forgot? I thought to myself. I quickly reply â€œHow are you tayoâ€ were we given an assignment?</p><p>No, he replied I just wanted to check on you.</p><p>We started chatting about random things; I thought he was being too familiar to believe we just started talking but being bored would make you do anything and reply to anything if it makes you feel better.</p><p>Since then we say hello to each other after lectures.</p><p>He has been my regular chat buddy on WhatsApp that I didn\'t think it through when he asked me to come to pay him a visit at his hostel and tutor him on some courses, after all, It was almost exam period, and I could use a study mate too.</p><p>I quickly put on black trousers, and a top packed my books into a bag and left for his place. When i got there I picked my phone up to tell him I was outside, the odour coming from the hostel was disgusting but since he isn\'t the only one living there I quickly waved it away, Must be from other rooms maybe they have smokers too here I thought. We got to a tiny looking apartment with strange faces staring at me I felt uncomfortable, sensing my displeasure he quickly introduced me to some of his friends and welcomed me to his hostel.</p><p>He offered me a drink, I refused. When I finally settled down to join them in the movie they were watching, his friends got up and made excuses about who they needed to visit and all.</p><p>One, in particular, was giving me this creepy look but Being an innocent and gullible girl that I was; I didn\'t read in between the lines.</p><p>It was silent.

My heart began to race this was looking Like the typical Hollywood movie when the actor wants to force himself on the victim the only difference was; with me, it was happening. He pushed me to the bed and increased the sound of the music. He started to unbuckle is a belt. â€œWhy are you so difficult? I am not going to hurt you i promise we would catch some fun and then read later baby relaxâ€ that was his exact words to me he was whispering.

No, i canâ€™t do that to them. My family.No they deserve better.

He got ready in a hurry and pushed me out.</p><p>I adjusted my cloth and &nbsp;started to run until my legs gave out</p><p>I cried like someone who has been beaten by a cruel teacher. The passerby watched from afar no one approached me. I walked all the way to my hostel and locked myself up. It all felt like a dream i didn\'t want to wake up. One thing i know was i wasn\'t raped; I could have been. A miracle happened. I don\'t see why it chooses that moment, but it did.</p><p>I didn\'t have the strength to go to school the following day</p><p>My coursemate called because they knew I wouldn\'t miss class for anything unless something happened, but i ignored all of their calls.</p><p>I have been avoiding school for a while now because i didn\'t want to face Tayo. I knew to report him was the best thing to do, but i was scared of all of the questions they would ask me.

(176, 'Exes (Episode Four)', 'Abdulhafeez Onitilo', 'show', '<p>Even though she never spoke about what happened the other night again she still thought about it and how crazy it would be if something like that would happen again. â€œ<i>I know it crazy but really I wouldnâ€™t mind for it to happen again</i>â€ she thought to herself. After her program, Mercy had to return home but instead of her going to her parentâ€™s house she went to her sisterâ€™s house in Ibadan.</p><p>Her elder sister was married but she hasnâ€™t been blessed with the gift of the womb though she once had a miscarriage which made her very sad. Due to work and some other stuff she with her husband who by the way works in a very big&nbsp;<i>I.T&nbsp;</i>firm havenâ€™t had the chance to try again. Mercy elder sister just opened up a boutique store and this was why Mercy went to stay with her so that she could help her out though every weekend whenever her&nbsp;sister&nbsp;didn\'t go to work Mercy would go to Onitsha to visit their parent.</p><p>There was this particular day she was in her sister store, sales were slow and she was feeling very bored and worst of all she was feeling horny. Normally she would have closed the shop and head home but she couldnâ€™t because her sister husband was beginning to flirt with her. She and her sister husband had once had sex with each other but that was way before he met her sister. Mercy didn\'t get to know her sister husband till the day they did their introduction and as at then it was too late for her to object to the relationship. Mercy and her sisterâ€™s husband both decided not to tell her sister that they once had a one night stand but then again, the guy in him wonâ€™t just let it be, after two months of Mercy stay, he started making moves on her again. This was why she couldnâ€™t go home if she wasn\'t horny she would have gone home because she knew how to handle herself but the fact that she is horny made her stay in the store and self-service herself.</p><p>She was in the rest room trying to satisfy her sexual urge when a customer walked into the store, â€œ<i>hello is anyone here</i>â€ the customer said. â€œ<i>I will be out in a minute</i>â€ she replied as she put on her pant and her jean and rushed out. â€œ<i>Good afternoon, how may I help you</i>â€ she said as she came out of the rest room. â€œI&nbsp;<i>am looking for a nice gown, something not too flashy yet sexy</i>â€ the customer said. â€œ<i>I think we have something you might like, please follow me</i>â€ she said as she led the way into another section of the store. The customer was busy gazing up the twisted G-string that expose Mercy ass when Mercy turned back and said â€œ<i>can you please hold this for me</i>â€ as she tried picking out one or two gowns from where it was hung. She was putting on a low waist jean and for her to get to where those gowns were she had to stretch a little bit since it wasn\'t on her height level and it was in the process of stretching that the customer eyes saw that her pant wasn\'t well worn. As Mercy handed her the gowns, she knew the customer was staring at her but she couldnâ€™t figure out why, â€œ<i>which&nbsp;of these would you prefer</i>â€ she said to the customer. Taking a look at the dress the customer whose mind wasn\'t on the gown anymore but on what she saw said â€œ<i>I am confuse I don\'t know which one to pick but I think I would prefer this black</i>â€ as she pointed to the black gown that Mercy was holding.&nbsp;&nbsp;â€œ<i>So how much would it cost it</i>? She asked. â€œ<i>15k</i>â€ she replied as she took a look at the price tag that was placed on the gown. Mercy wanted the customer gone as quick as possible so she could go back to what she was doing, immediately the customer agreed to pay the money, she went to package the gown for her without asking any further question. The customer couldnâ€™t erase the thought of Mercy expose ass off her mind so she tried to see if she could prolong their discussion by asking her about shoes. â€œ<i>What about a shoe to match, can you help with that</i>â€ the customer said. Mercy didn\'t hear the customer which the customer noticed so she moved close to where Mercy was and that was how she saw what gave her the perfect edge to strike up a conversation. It was after their conversation and they had gotten each otherâ€™s contact that was Mercy realized she didnâ€™t even know the name of the customer. â€œ<i>So what should I call you</i>? Mercy asked. â€œ<i>Call me Seun</i>â€ the customer replied.</p><p>Seunâ€™s uncle was having a dinner party and he had given her some cash to get a dress since she complained that she didn\'t have what to wear and that was how she ended up in Mercy store. After she left the store, Seun couldnâ€™t stop thinking about Mercy and how lovely it would be if she could be her girlfriend though she wasn\'t sure if she is a lesbian or not. She did invite her to her uncleâ€™s party but Mercy declined the offer because her sisterâ€™s husband too had a party they were all going to attend. She wasn\'t even sure if she would have said yes to Seunâ€™s invitation because she knew parties like that would involve two things: men and drinks and the latter has a very bad effect on her so the dinner she was going with her&nbsp;sisterand her husband was a perfect excuse she made use of.</p><p>The dinner party was to honour Mercy sister\'s husband and some of his colleague who were recently promoted to different position and also to introduce the new project the company was about to launch into the market. The event was very colourful and exciting that Mercy was glad she agreed to follow them. She was having so much fun as her sister\'s husband kept introducing her and her sister to some of his colleagues as they all waited for the big moment. The product they were launching was a mobile application device called â€œReadMeâ€ and this device is designed to actually read people and guess correctly what that person is thinking or is planning to do. It also has a button that studies your emotional and psychological state to help you come up with the best possible solution when someone was is in distress. Before she saw the face, Mercy knew the person she was looking at was familiar because of the cloth the person was putting on. From where Mercy was seated she could only see the personâ€™s side view which wasn\'t good enough for her but immediately the man that made the prototype of&nbsp;<i>ReadMe</i>&nbsp;stood up and walked to the stage, she saw her but the person she saw didn\'t see her till that person and the man that made the prototype got to the stage.</p>', 'uploads/15494138733379060exes.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '00:44:33', '2019-02-06', '1549413873c499el9e9t40a8s2ire1x', 1, 'thumb/15494138739178843exes.jpg', 1, 395, NULL),
(177, 'Exes (Episode five)', 'Abdulhafeez Onitilo', 'show', '<p>Their relationship wasn\'t too serious but it was interesting as they both enjoyed what they were having. It was a new experience for Mercy who had never had a romantic relationship with any girl though there was this one time she got drunk, she and her friend kissed and fingered each other but that doesnâ€™t really count because she was under the influence of alcohol. As for Seun who had been a full lesbian all her life, having sex with a guy was also a new experience for her as it was part of the condition Mercy gave if they were going to date</p><p>Mercy was surprise to have seen Seun at the party but she was more surprised when she found out that her sisterâ€™s husband and Seun uncle were colleagues. â€œ<i>I never knew Mr. Biola is your uncle</i>â€ Mercy said when she and Seun finally got the chance to talk. â€œ<i>I also didn\'t know that you know my uncle, I guess it is small world after all</i>â€ Seun replied. â€œ<i>It is a small world indeed</i>â€ Mercy said as they both continued chatting with each other. After that night they began to see each other, as a matter of fact whenever Mercy was in her aunty store and sales were slow or she was feeling bored, she would speed dial Seun to come keep her company and that was how they got close and finally started dating each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Every six month they would go clubbing, flirt with a guy and finally they would both have sex with the guy. It was Mercy that came up with the idea of going to the club and picking the guy that would have sex with them. What they do is simple, they both go to the club but once they get to the club they separate as couple and this would give guys the chance of flirting with them. Whoever a guy flirts with among them would make sure the guy have a reason to see her the next day and since they both have an idea the kind of guy they are targeting they don\'t have problem with each other choice. A month after one of them would have met a guy from the club that is when they would have sex with the guy but there also a trick to that and this trick was Seunâ€™s idea. Let say for that month it was Mercy that brought home the guy they are supposed to have sex with, she would have informed Seun on when to come into the room so she would catch them in the act.&nbsp;</p><p>Now on arriving at the scene Seun would act as a jealous girlfriend who just caught her girlfriend cheating on her, she would lock the door saying she wonâ€™t allow the guy to leave until he has sex with both of them, uttering these exact words â€œ<i>I am not going to allow you get away with this, if you are going to cheat then we would do it together</i>â€. It would naturally take a very spiritually inclined guy to see both Mercy and Seun naked and would still reject having sex with them, they have all that a man would sexual desire in a girl.</p><p>Nkechi was now really enjoying her relationship with Lekan because not only did Lekan now travel less, whenever he goes on short distance trips he takes her along and that never made her lonely again. There was this particular month that Lekan travelled to for an impromptu job that wasn\'t supposed to last more than two days instead it lasted for a week. A lot of unexpected event occurred to both of them within the space of that one week and it was this event that changed the course of their relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nkechi dilemma started with the phone call she placed to a number she found on her phone while she was just scrolling through her contact, she had thought she had deleted the number because she actually said was going to, she didn\'t want to keep in touch with that person. It was a surprise to her when she saw the number and that brought back some memories she had forgotten and just out of curiosity she decided to call the number, that call changed everything.</p><p><br>As for Lekan his own predicament started when he and some of his friends that were with him on the job trip decided to hit the club and grab one or two beers just to ease the tension of the work. They had been working for three day without any form of relaxation so they all decided to take that night off and relax. Lekan came across this pretty&nbsp;<i>bae,</i>&nbsp;he decided to make a move on her and that move lead to a series of unexpected revelation.</p>', 'uploads/15494143318185937exes.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '00:52:11', '2019-02-06', '154941433138e074s8eet9lr9i9a0xc', 1, 'thumb/15494143318570123exes.jpg', 1, 473, NULL),
(178, 'Exes (Episode Six)', 'Abdulhafeez Onitilo', 'show', '<p>â€œ<i>Excuse me miss, I am David by name and I hope you wouldnâ€™t mind if I talk to you for a bit</i>â€ he said as he walked up to the girl. David was his flirting name, whenever he is out drinking and just want to flirt around that is the alias he uses. Yes he was attracted to the girl but if his friends had not pushed him he wouldnâ€™t have walked up to her, he would have just continued to admire her quietly. â€œ<i>You talking to me is no problem but I am not sure I would be interested in what you have to say</i>â€ the girl said back. If there was one thing Lekan was good at its being able to read people and base on the way the girl was dressed Lekan read her perfectly. â€œ<i>A pretty girl like you all in&nbsp;&nbsp;the club by herself, dressed in a very sexy and comfy dress, I would say you are here to have fun and I can definitely give you that, that of course if you allow me too</i>â€ Lekan said. â€œ<i>And how do you intend doing that exactly</i>â€ she asked him. â€œ<i>First, allow me start by buying you a drink and we can talk further</i>â€ and that was how Lekan was able to get her full attention and they actually had a lot of fun before they left the club.</p><p>â€œ<i>Hello Nkechi is that you</i>? The person on the other line said as she picked the call. Nkechi didn\'t know what to say but when she found her voice she said this â€œ<i>you still sound the same</i>â€. â€œ<i>Were you expecting me to sound different</i>? The person she called asked. â€œ<i>I didn\'t mean it like that, I was probably expecting you to be mad at me considering how.........</i>â€. â€œ<i>Why should I be? You made your decision and I have learnt how to leave with it, you have moved on and I am also trying to do the same</i>â€ the person she was talking to said as she cut her short. â€œ<i>I am sorry for what I did, I know that wasn\'t the plan and I am sure you wonâ€™t probably believe me if I tell you</i>â€ Nkechi said. â€œ<i>Now that you have called me why don\'t you give it a try at least I would listen even if I wonâ€™t believe youâ€</i>&nbsp;the receiver said. And that was how Nkechi began to explain everything that happened and why she had to behave the way she did. The way they ended their conversation wasn\'t the way Nkechi had expected it to end, it ended on a more laughing note rather than on an apologetic note.</p><p>Mercy had gone to Onitsha to spend some days with her parent as she was called that her mum wasn\'t feeling too well. So that particular weekend that Seun went to the club Mercy wasn\'t around but Seun was able to fill her in via phone call and chatting. Some few minutes after she had just finish talking with Mercy her phone rang and she was very surprise when she saw the name that appeared on the screen. The name she saw on the screen was the last person she was expecting a call from, that why when the phone first rang she didn\'t want to receive it because she didn\'t even know what to say. On the second ring she decided to pick it up saying â€œ<i>at least let me hear what she has to say</i>â€ but she was confused and was forced to talk first when she picked the call and she didn\'t hear a word from the caller for about thirty seconds and that was when she said â€œ<i>Hello Nkechi is that you</i>?</p><p>There was this sensational feeling she was having as she spoke with Seun, it been close to two years since they both went their separate ways yet that her voice still had a solid effect on her. As they kept on talking she began to reminisce about all those time that they had together and she didn\'t know when she said â€œ<i>I sometimes wish we can still be together</i>â€. It was this statement that lead to more complicated issue with her present relationship, Seun too couldnâ€™t deny the fact that she missed what she and Nkechi had and that she also sometimes wish they were still together. There was a long pause after Nkechi made that statement but Seun broke the pause by saying â€œ<i>I wish the same too</i>â€ and it was at this point Seun began to tell her about her current relationship. â€œ<i>I canâ€™t believe it, you have started having sex with men</i>â€ Nkechi said when she had the terms in which Mercy gave before she could date her. â€œ<i>My dear na my story be that ooo and talking about guys self, where this your guy come dey way you get time to call me for midnight so?</i>&nbsp;Seun said. â€œ<i>He went for a job in Ibadan although him suppose don come back but him say the work go delay small</i>â€ she replied. â€œ<i>Alright babe me won crash, it been very nice hearing your voice, hope we can talk soon</i>â€ Seun said. â€œ<i>Definitely we shall talk soon and this time I promise to keep to my promise</i>â€ she replied before they both said their final good bye. Nkechi didnâ€™t get to sleep till probably thirty minutes after the phone call as she was still reminiscing about her and Seun and wondering how it would feel if they were still together or if they could still have sex one more time.</p><p>Lekan was suppose to see Seun the next day after the club but due to work he couldnâ€™t, he was very stressed that he just went to the hotel he was staying to rest. He called her to inform her that he wonâ€™t be able to make it for their date and asked her if they could reschedule for the following day and she agreed to. As Lekan was relaxing he was also plotting how he was going to get under Seun pant before he leaves Ibadan. â€œ<i>I no won long thing with this bae, just do what I want to do sharp sharp, cant risk Nkechi finding out</i>â€ and it was when he spoke of Nkechi he actually remembered that he promised her he was going to call her back and since yesterday that he said so he hasnâ€™t. Immediately he picked up his phone from the side of the bed, he dialled her number. Nkechi was taking a shower when he first called so she wasn\'t able to pick it up at first ring, it was on the third ring that she came out of the shower and she picked up. â€œ<i>Hello dear I am sorry for not picking up, I was in the bathroom</i>â€ she said immediately she picked the call. â€œ<i>That alright</i>â€ he said before he began asking her how she was and how her day has been.</p><p>He was a bit disappointed that he wasn\'t able to have sex with Seun before leaving Ibadan though it wasn\'t as if he was also hell bent on doing it, just that he felt he had a shot at it and he didn\'t take it. Seun made him a promise before he left and it was that promise that gingered him to go ahead with her&nbsp;<i>parole</i>, he believe it was what he said to her that made her make that promise so he felt he his game plan was working but little did he know that it was actually Seunâ€™s game plan that was working and he was the one been played.</p><p>He was supposed to go back to Lagos on Thursday but since he knew that his plan to get Seun to sleep with him wasn\'t going to work he decided to leave on Wednesday and Nkechi wasn\'t expecting that. He got home around past six that evening and what he witnessed wasn\'t what he was expecting.</p>', 'uploads/15494150437821260exes.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '01:04:03', '2019-02-06', '15494150434ti7s6c85lxe6404eear2', 1, 'thumb/15494150432651907exes.jpg', 1, 355, NULL),

He knocked only once after which he noticed the door wasn\'t locked with key so he went straight in, on getting in, he saw an empty bottle of red wine on the small centre table in his sitting room and with that he knew she had been drinking. That was the first clue that made him suspect something was wrong, she doesnâ€™t alone and when she does she has never finished a bottle of red wine before, he started to think what could be wrong as he hurried up the stairs to check up on her.</p><p>He stood by the door watching in amusement waiting for the right time to join the fun but he was surprise when he heard what she said. What he saw at first was his girlfriend who had drank a whole bottle of red wine which made her horny and decides to help herself (that was what he thought the case was), so he decided to stare at her for a while before going in to make love to her not knowing she was on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching her self-servicing herself for about five to ten minutes, he was also getting an erection and he felt this was the right time to move in, coincidentally it was at that same exactly time she said this â€œ<i>I really miss having sex with you, I mean I enjoy having sex with my guy but na guy him be and you be woman and that canâ€™t be compared</i>â€.</p><p>Slowly and gently Lekan removed his hands from his already hard manhood as he couldnâ€™t believe what he just heard. Her sleeping position when Lekan saw her was on her right hand side and the phone was close to her ear that was why Lekan couldnâ€™t see it, but as she said those words she turned straight facing the ceiling and holding the phone in a much more visible position that Lekan could see. While Lekan was still standing close to the door in shock over what he heard, she spoke again â€œ<i>can you make me cum please, I missed that feeling</i>â€ she said. He had series of questions like â€œ<i>is she truly a lesbian? How long has she been doing this? Who the hell was she talking to on the phone</i>? The best he could do was to continue drinking the bottles of beer that he had in his front as he couldnâ€™t find the answers to the questions that he was asking. After he was very much convinced that she was having phone sex with another girl he carefully left the house and headed for the bar. He didn\'t go home that night instead he spent the night in a friend house, he tried explaining his situation to his friend maybe the friend could help make sense of it but the respond his friend gave wasn\'t helpful. He decided to go home and act like he didn\'t know what had transpired between his girlfriend and the girl over the phone.</p><p>Nkechi was so happy seen him as he jumped on him and placed a kiss on him saying â€œ<i>I have missed you so muchâ€</i>. In a very relaxed tone he said â€œ<i>I can only imagine</i>â€. â€œ<i>Gosh see the way you sounding, your journey must be very exhausting, go take your shower while I prepare your favourite meal</i>â€ she said to him as she followed him to the bedroom before she headed to the kitchen. After taking his shower before heading back to the sitting room he got a call and the caller told him something that took his mind off the whole scene that he had witnessed when he first came home yesterday, before receiving the call he had decided to head to the sitting room and confront Nkechi concerning what he saw and see what would happen but after receiving the phone call he changed his mind.</p><p>Seun and Mercy had agreed on the time there were going to have sex with the guy Seun met in the club. While Mercy wasn\'t around after Seun had fill her in on how things had been going between them. â€œ<i>I told him to come next week, I told him I was having a little get-together and I said I have a surprise for him</i>â€. So what did he say? Mercy asked. â€œ<i>Well he didn\'t say much but trust me I know he is excited, you know guys na dem go won form</i>â€ she replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout that week Mercy and Seun were planning how exactly they were going to trick Lekan into sleeping with them both at the same time Seun was contemplating on whether to tell Lekan the truth that he wasn\'t going to be having sex with her alone because she had already given him the hint that they were going to have sex when next they see each other. Lekan on the other hand was also battling with his own issuing, he wasn\'t still sure want to do concerning what he saw and heard Nkechi doing, there were times he would sit her down to ask her if she was a lesbian but somewhere along the line he would just ask her a different and sometimes unnecessary question.</p><p>Seun and Nkechi kept on having phone sex without their partners knowing, since Lekan got back from Ibadan Nkechi had only slept in his house once and that was that very day he got back, expect from that day she would go sleep in her own apartment and Lekan never questioned her because he suspected she wanted to be alone so could continue having&nbsp; phone sex with the mysterious girl. Lekan had made up his mind to find out who the girl was before he confronted her but that didn\'t take place till after his trip to Ibadan which also didn\'t go according to plan.</p>', 'uploads/15523426258186082BLIHMB9e_400x400.png', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '22:17:07', '2019-03-11', '1552342627ear3esxltie4c', 1, 'thumb/1552342625347372BLIHMB9e_400x400.png', 0, 221, NULL),

Normally whenever Lekan returns from a job trip like that, the next three days was going to be a sex marathon but this wasn\'t like that, she didn\'t make any plan like she was supposed to and the fact that she wasn\'t even sleeping in his house said a lot. If Lekan had not seen her moaning over the phone he would have probably initiated the sex marathon but he still hasnâ€™t been able to put his head around the fact that his girlfriend might be bi or possibly a full time lesbian, so sticking his manhood up her ass wasn\'t just feeling right.</p><p>â€œ<i>I really have a feeling I should tell this guy that he wonâ€™t be having sex with me alone, something is telling me he would go for it</i>â€ Seun said. â€œ<i>Why you go won tell am, is that how we have been doing it or wait, are you having feelings for this guy</i>â€ Mercy replied. â€œ<i>Feelings ke, bae I am a lesbian, David just seems like an adventurous kind of guy that all</i>â€ she replied her back.&nbsp;<i>Why am I even bothered, itâ€™s your turn to come up with a plan on how we are both going to get his manhood inside us, so bae do what you have to do, koko be say he sleeps with us</i>â€&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercy said as she stood up from the chair she was seated on and left for the toilet that was in the store.</p><p>Nkechi had pleaded with Seun to come to Lagos so they could catch up and obviously have sex, she told Seun that her boyfriend would be away for the weekend but Seun told her she wasn\'t going to be free that weekend â€œ<i>I go dey busy for Friday and Saturday, maybe next time shaâ€&nbsp;</i>Seun said to her. Nkechi went on to her ask if she could come on Sunday and she gave it a maybe saying â€œ<i>that if you are sure that your boyfriend wonâ€™t be back by then</i>â€. Lekan had told Nkechi he was going to Abeokuta for another job trip and after that he was going to spend a little time with his elder sister who also stays in Abeokuta, so Nkechi was so sure that he wasn\'t going to be around for at least a week. Seun had informed Mercy she was going to Lagos on Sunday, she said her uncle was sending her on an errand and she wonâ€™t be back till Tuesday.</p><p>Lekan got to Ibadan around 6pm and after he had settled in with one of his friends he gave Seun a call letting her know he was in town and if they could see that evening. Seun politely turn him down using this as an excuse â€œ<i>don\'t let me trouble you tonight when I am still going to trouble you tomorrow, just make sure you rest and save your energy for tomorrow because I know you going to need it</i>â€. â€œ<i>Hmmm I like it when you talk like that but be warned I don\'t get tired that easy</i>â€ Lekan replied her. She meant every word of it when she said â€œ<i>trust me you are going to be more than tired tomorrow</i>â€, If they were going to rate how good both Seun and Mercy were on bed they would probably get an 8 and 9 over 10.</p><p>â€œ<i>What the hell is going on here</i>? She asked as she came into the room to see Seun been stripped naked by David. She was dumbfounded when David turned to face her, she forgot her rehearsed speech and all she could say was â€œ<i>Oh My God Oh My God.........</i>â€ and that was when Seun got up from the bed to meet her. She tried acting her part maybe Mercy was going to remember her part â€œI&nbsp;<i>can explain baby it is not what it seems like</i>â€ she said as she was giving her eye contact to play along. â€œ<i>I am sorry but I think I have to take my leaveâ€</i>&nbsp;Lekan said as he got up from the bed and that was when Mercy played along but not in the way Seun was expecting but definitely the way Lekan had thought she would when he turned and saw his ex-girlfriend staring at him. â€œ<i>No no no, nobody is going anywhere until you explain to me why you are sleeping with my girlfriend</i>â€ Mercy said but as Seun was trying to stick to her script Mercy let the cat out of the bag as she said â€œ<i>do you hate me this much Lekan, breaking my heart wasn\'t enough for you that you have to sleep with my girlfriend now</i>â€.&nbsp;<i>What!</i>&nbsp;Seun said as she couldnâ€™t believe what she was hearing. â€œ<i>Yes Seun this is the ex I told you about and his name is not David his name is Lekan</i>â€ Mercy said facing Seun before she faced Lekan who just stood there quiet as he didn\'t know what to say. â€œ<i>I am so sorry Mercy I didn\'t know he was the one if not I wouldnâ€™t have flirt with him</i>â€ Seun said right before Lekan said â€œ<i>that true I didn\'t know she is your girlfriend perhaps the last time I checked you werenâ€™t a lesbian</i>â€. â€œ<i>Just shut up your mouth you this good for nothing guy, what I decide to do with my life isnâ€™t your business anymore</i>â€ Mercy said out of anger as Seun moved closer to her, calmed her down before pulling her aside to talk to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Lekan just stood there trying to understand why he has been out of luck lately, he just found out that his girlfriend is having an affair with a girl and now his supposed side chick is also a lesbian â€œ<i>I mean what could be worse than this</i>â€ he thought.</p>', 'uploads/15523429645565386BLIHMB9e_400x400.png', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '22:22:46', '2019-03-11', '1552342966e9xs9claierte', 1, 'thumb/15523429646796814BLIHMB9e_400x400.png', 0, 124, NULL),

She asked. â€œ<i>Sis I don\'t know that why I came here, I am just confusedâ€.&nbsp;</i>â€œ<i>Do you love her</i>? His sister asked. â€œ<i>Really sis, if I didn\'t I wonâ€™t be bothered, I for don send her pack in since</i>â€. â€œ<i>Alright I would suggest you give her the chance to explain herself, ask if the lesbian thing is something of the past or if she also doing it on the side</i>â€. â€œ<i>That is the point sis, I am scared of it been a thing on the side</i>â€. â€œ<i>If you truly love her then you need to know her mind because if you don\'t know her mind any decision you make might just be the wrong</i>â€ her&nbsp;<i>sis</i>&nbsp;said.</p><p>â€œ<i>See you have to believe me I have no idea he was the ex you told me about</i>â€ Seun said again after Lekan had finally gone. â€œ<i>I believe you it just that I thought I was completely over him, seen him today just brought back some memories</i>â€ Mercy replied. â€œ<i>I am sorry dear, what do you need me to do</i>? Seun asked. â€œ<i>Don\'t worry I would have to handle this by myself perhaps you have an errand to run for your uncle if not I would have love to have you around just in case I need someone to talk to</i>â€ she replied. â€œ<i>Don\'t worry I would cancel the trip, I can give my uncle an excuseâ€</i>&nbsp;she said. â€œ<i>Seun you don\'t have to worry at least na just two days you dey spend, I can manage that</i>â€ Mercy replied. Mercy did a lot of thinking while Seun was in Lagos, seen Lekan again did brought back some memories both good and bad ones, and at the end she saw herself laughing because she just realized that she had a lot of good memories with Lekan.</p><p>Lekan journey to Lagos was a very thoughtful one and the decision he arrived at was very unexpected, he concluded he wasn\'t going to tell her that he knew about her been a lesbian instead he was going to propose to her with the assumption that she would say yes and maybe that would just change her mind about the whole lesbian thing. When he got to Lagos he went to a jewellery store, got her a ring before heading to her house, he didn\'t bother to call her because he wanted to surprise her but on getting there he was the one that was surprise.</p><p>Seun got to Lagos around 4pm and just like Nkechi had said she was waiting for her at the park. She hired a taxi that took them from the park to her house as she was so excited to see her. After settling down in Nkechi house Seun decided to call Mercy to check up on her, â€œ<i>how was your journey</i>? Mercy asked. â€œ<i>It was fine and you, how you coping</i>? Seun asked. â€œ<i>Well I am doing fine, I am home didn\'t go to the store today</i>â€. â€œ<i>Hope all is well</i>? Seun asked in a concern tone. â€œ<i>Yes everything is fine, I just wanted to rest that allâ€</i>&nbsp;she replied. â€œ<i>Okay please I hope you aint thinking about what happenedâ€,</i>it was when Seun said this statement that Nkechi walked into the room. â€œ<i>Who was that</i>? She asked after Seun had finished her call. â€œThat was my girlfriendâ€ she replied. â€œ<i>Oh I see, I guess you have to switch off your phone because I wouldnâ€™t want any calls to disturb us most especially when we are getting it down</i>â€ Nkechi said. â€œ<i>I am sorry but I canâ€™t do that, remember I told about out little agreement</i>â€ she replied back. â€œ<i>Yes you did and what about it</i>? She said. â€œ<i>Well yesterday we were supposed to have sex with this guy that flirted with me only for us to find out that the guy was his ex boyfriend</i>â€.<i>Oh My God! That weird how did you guys find out</i>? Nkechi asked and that was how Seun told her everything that transpired. â€œ<i>Poor girl, how is she doing now?&nbsp;</i>Nkechi asked<i>. â€œWell she said she would be fine but I have told her to call me whenever she needs to talk, at least that the least I can do for her</i>â€ Seun replied. â€œ<i>If you had told me this I would have asked you to stay with her, now I am feeling like a terrible person</i>â€ Nkechi said. â€œ<i>Come on babe this had nothing to do with you perhaps I offered to stay but she said she would be fine though I feel bad too because she doesnâ€™t really know why I am here</i>â€. â€œ<i>Well since you feel bad and I am feeling bad why not we get totally bad</i>â€ Nkechi said with a smile on her face. â€œ<i>Are you suggesting what I am thinking</i>? Seun asked. â€œ<i>I am only saying there is whiskey in the sitting room and you know how bad we get on whiskey</i>â€ Nkechi said.&nbsp;<i>â€œYou know sometimes I wish you had remained that classroom girl</i>â€ Seun said. â€œ<i>Well if I had you wouldnâ€™t have the opportunity to taste and enjoy this sweet lovely girl</i>â€ she said as she used her hand to touch her breast before she placed a kissed on her as she whispered â€œ<i>let go get the drink</i>â€.</p><p>After they had almost down a whole bottle of whiskey they started to make love to each other not before Nkechi had locked the door and placed the key on the centre table. As she was coming back to meet Seun on the chair she was seated, Seun stood up and met her with a kiss. She returned the kiss as she grabbed her tight, after kissing for about five minutes Nkechi pulled away a little and when she returned to Seun arms she was placing kisses all over her body as she was standing and moaning gently. As she was been kissed, Seunâ€™s hands were on Nkechi hair as she was curling it right before she also jacked Nkechi up and placed a kiss on her neck from the side down to the middle of her chest. Nkechi was putting on a three buttoned shirt and as Seun was placing the kiss on her she used her tongue to release the buttons, after that she placed another hot kiss on her right before she pulled her shirt up and started placing kisses below her breast. Nkechi was also getting busy as she too was caressing Seunâ€™s body using her hand to touch some sensitivity part on her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Seun was busy using her tongue to caress Nkechiâ€™s body, Nkechi was also busy as she was able to unhook Seunâ€™s bra without taking off her shirt. After unhooking the bra she pulled her up placed a kiss on her before taking off the blouse she was wearing.&nbsp;</p><p>Her smile was broad when she saw the exposed breast of Seun and like a year old baby that has been staved of food she began sucking Seun breast. While her mouth were busy sucking and licking Seun breast, Seunâ€™s hands too were busy caressing Nkechi breast. After sucking her a bit she pulled away as she took away her top as they became topless, Seun pushed Nkechi to the chair before she met her with another hot kiss that lasted for about 10 minutes and after that Seun transferred the kiss from the mouth to the neck to the breast to the belly button as she used her hand to unzipped her trousers before placing some kiss on the tip of her virginal which sent a sensational feeling to Nkechi spine. Without wasting time she pulled off Nkechiâ€™s trousers exposing her pant as she took the kiss from the top of her virginal back to her lips. Nkechiâ€™s nipple became red hot as Seun was sucking it gently while using her hands to press and caress it. Nkechiâ€™s body quavered as Seun uses her finger to touch her clitoris without taking off her pant, she moaned a little bit louder before she whispered some words into her ears and it was after those words Seun got up and they both headed to the room but that wasn\'t before Seun did a quick play with her tongue on Nkechiâ€™s clitoris.</p><p>At exactly 6:30pm Lekan was in front of Nkechiâ€™s door as he took another look at the ring he had bought, hoping she would say yes to him and they can moved pass this her lesbian thing. He would have headed home with the believe that Nkechi wasn\'t at home but he noticed that one side of the curtain was opened so he tried knocking again but as he was about to he remembered he had his own spare key which he had never even used before. There was the big flower vase outside the house and it was beneath it that he hid the key, so he went there to pick up the key opened the door and went in. At first he couldnâ€™t comprehend what was going on, he saw two set of braziers on the floor, two different female tops, a bottle of whiskey and the trouser he both for Nkechi, all at different location in the sitting room and this made him very puzzled. He looked at the scene again and this time his eyes were more focus on the bottle of whiskey as he remembered that the last time he saw an empty bottle of alcohol his girlfriend was having phone sex and that was when it dawn on him that Nkechi might just be having sex with someone at the moment.</p><p>Nkechi was the one fingering Seun at the moment, she started with a finger before increasing to two and from two to three from three to four. As her fingers were inside Seunâ€™s p***y, her mouth and the remaining fingers were busy with Seunâ€™s breast as Seun was also using her to grab Nkechiâ€™s breast whenever she could. Nkechiâ€™s body began to quaver in a way she never imagined was possible as Seun decided to take over the show, she laid Nkechi on her back, kept her legs wide apart right before she started sucking and licking her clitoris for about 15minutes and this was when Nkechi started groaning really loud that it caught the attention of Lekan. Lekan was still in the sitting room lost in the thought of what he was going to do if he goes into the room and truly finds out that Nkechi is having sex with another girl. It was the moaning of Nkechi that brought him out of his thought and without thinking this time around he rushed to the bedroom and he almost had a heart attack with what he saw. Seunâ€™s head was buried in between Nkechi legs as Nkechi was biting her lips, twisting her hips at the same time playing with her tits. â€œ<i>Jesus Christ! What in Godâ€™s name is this</i>â€ he said as he came and saw what was happening.</p>', 'uploads/15554622677964189BLIHMB9e_400x400.png', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '00:51:09', '2019-04-17', '15554622690rtc0al10ei0', 1, 'thumb/15554622675959329BLIHMB9e_400x400.png', 0, 136, NULL),

Her biggest bewilderment came when she saw and heard the reacting of Seun towards Lekan and that was how she too lost it. Seun was shock to find out that Lekan is Nkechi boyfriend the same Lekan that is Mercy ex, she turned to Nkechi told her that the guy standing across them is the same guy she was telling her about few hours ago.</p><p>Lekan catching Nkechi in bed with another girl wasn\'t what really shocked him but what did was the fact that the girl his girlfriend was having sex with is the same girl he would have had sex with if what happened in Ibadan didn\'t happen. After the initial shock statement of&nbsp;<i>what in God name is this</i>&nbsp;all three of them were quiet as they kept on staring at each other since words were finding it hard to come out. Finally Seun was the one who broke the silence as she asked Nkechi if the person standing in front of them was truly her boyfriend and with Nkechi answer been positive Seun decided to spill the beans concerning what went down in Ibadan and that was how Lekan was exposed. Lekan too spilled the beans on how he came home the other time only to find her having phone sex with a girl and that was the reason he gave for his actions at Ibadan. Once again Seun was the one on the apology end as she apologise to Nkechi for flirting with her boyfriend saying she wouldnâ€™t have if she had known better. Lekan didn\'t give Nkechi the chance to speak or probably explain herself because after he had revealed what he saw the other day he came home, he left her house without saying any word although Nkechi tried getting his attention saying they should sort things out before leaving but it was obvious that Lekan had already sorted things out in his mind as he left the house without looking back.</p><p>Mercy had thought about her life and the direction she had wanted it to go and she knew it wouldnâ€™t be the same direction Seun was thinking and with that her thought became more of how to break up with her than how hurt she would be when she does. Seun returned back from Lagos on Tuesday just like she had said she would just that she was early and that was why Mercy was surprise to see her at the store.&nbsp;&nbsp;After exchanging pleasantries, Seun sounding so happy to be back and all that, Mercy had a very long conversation with Seun and the conversation ended up with Seun smiling out of the store which was not expected at all.</p><p>Seun took the break up from Mercy very well because she knew that things between Nkechi and Lekan were not going to work out and what perfect time was it for her to win her love back if not now. She thanked Mercy for giving her the chance of at least dating her even though she wasn\'t a lesbian and also wished her all the best in life before she finally left the store. They remained friends, kept in touch via phone calls and through chatting but they never saw each other again after that day Seun left the store. After a month that Seun came back from Lagos she took another trip to Lagos but this time she was going to see her girlfriend, winning Nkechi back was easier than she thought and just like they had planned it once they started living together just that it was Seun that move into Nkechi house and not the other way round.</p><p>As for Lekan and Mercy it was a case of&nbsp;<i>the devil you know is better than the angel you don\'t know</i>, Lekan realised the mistake he did with Mercy and decided to try his luck to see if this time they could work things out. Mercy too had secretly wished that Lekan would come back because after seen him that day with Seun she hasnâ€™t been able to stop thinking about the good times they had together and how far they would have gone with their relationship if she hadnâ€™t reacted the way she did the day she caught him having phone sex.

(209, 'Shades of Failure', 'Aderonke Adetona', 'show', '<p>Get in here girl!</p><p>That was my friend\'s first opening speech when she called me. What now? I murmured. I drag my feet to the lecture theatre, Kicking each stone as I pass them. I don\'t like Afternoon Lectures. What would it cost them to Reschedule this class? The stupid department, I was ranting to myself. The place was so noisy; there were about 200 students in the class. Some were gisting and shouting while Others had a sober look on them. &nbsp;Immediately I sat down; the lecturer came in. He started introducing a topic to us. I wasn\'t listening. Why did you call me in that manner I faced my friend, it\'s not like the course is that serious to start with, I whisper yelled. Our result is out! That grabbed my attention. I thought It was going to take months for that to happen since that has been the usual practice of the school. Which of them?</p><p>Chm and bio. She replied.</p><p>Have you checked? How was it? I bombarded her with a lot of Questions. I would tell you after class; she wasn\'t about to allow me to distract her from listening to the lecturer now. I hate suspense! You know I hate it!. Why won\'t you tell me now? Itâ€™s not like I carried it or something? I looked from her to the lecturer; the man was trying to say something I didn\'t hear. Something about us reducing the noise or he leaves. I didn\'t care. She didn\'t reply to me until I heard a faint â€˜Yes.â€™ I wanted to tell her to stop joking until I saw the look on her face. Damn, she was serious. Wow, I said. I didn\'t know what to say; Another friend answered Wow? To a 3 unit course? It\'s that what you are supposed to say! Am I supposed to be crying? Is that how am suppose to feel? I replied. At that point, I don\'t even know how to react.</p><p>Wish you could hear a thousand thoughts going on in my head. I pretended nothing happened and started paying attention to the lecturer once again, but my train of thought was somewhere else â€œThis is all a sick jokeâ€ They are kidding. You all should laugh and tell me it\'s a prank and tell me to relax and stop being too serious. &nbsp;I swear I Read for that course. Heaven knows I did. At the end of the lecture. I need to take a look myself, I told them. Catch Ya later. I left them to see for myself. It\'s a mistake, how am I going to do this, there is nowhere to add it if I need to retake the course, God. Why now?. It\'s at the back of the HOD\'s door if it\'s your result you all are looking for.</p><p>Matric no 01 let me check, please...Its an F. It all dawned on me. They werenâ€™t kidding. Holy cow! I did carry the course. What now? What next? I was thinking out loud; I can\'t sit for this course in finals. What if I didn\'t pass it again? Would that mean I would spill? No way! Heavens Forbid. Not on my mummy\'s not enough salary. I was battling with it in my head watching people who were rolling on the floor, crying. At that point I was feeling numb, I didn\'t know whether to cry or laugh. Or maybe I should do both.</p><p>I can\'t even bring myself to do any. I am emotionless as fuck. Permit me to use the word, but thatâ€™s how I feel in reality. It\'s okay I tell myself, You are a strong woman I affirmed, but my thoughts weren\'t agreeing. That course is hard, â€˜Donâ€™t go for it. Donâ€™t say I didn\'t warn youâ€™ those words keep ringing in my head. They were everything that was said to me before coming to school. Who am I going to tell now? They won\'t listen. They are all going to say to me I told you so. I left the place for my hostel. The only place I can get comfortable in my bed. I would sleep and move on. It won\'t matter if I don\'t think about it at least that\'s what I told myself, but it wasn\'t as easy as I thought. It was until I got to my hostel to write about my day every emotion come flooding. I was crying. I did. I needed it for my sanity. I wiped my tears away until there isn\'t a single drop left. Itâ€™s not the end of the world girl! Nothing is! And nothing deserves your tears now. Show the world what you got! That was my new mantra. I resolved that very moment, no matter how bad my situation gets. Nothing ever deserves my tears. I remember those words in motivation speech. If you didn\'t fail at any point in your life, you have not grown as a person; you have just been adding numbers to your years. Fail forward! When life throws you a curve ball ask if that\'s the only thing it got? The reason I felt that way that day wasn\'t because carryover was a life sentence; it was because society has brainwashed our thinking to accept failure as a death sentence. Get an excellent grade that\'s the only way you can have a better life than your parents, that\'s the only way you can be a good daughter. In a bid to be somebody, we took failure as a No No., Nobody is ready to fail. Nobody wants to, but the bitter truth is. If we don\'t fail at some point in life, we would never have the experience of how to do better, how to move on in bad situations. I am not saying it\'s ok to fail courses just because we all have to fail at some point. The point I am trying to drive home is how to accept failure. A lot of people are committing suicides because of different things. It\'s a controversial topic I know, and I would not want to dive into it too. The reality is, 50% of reasons why people are committing suicide or slipping into depression nowadays is because they haven\'t accepted failure as part of life and Until we are ready to take that fact Failure would be Something we all dread</p>', 'uploads/15578644354226099IMG_20190514_WA0012.jpg', '1546847130dk032o2aen3r22e559', '20:07:17', '2019-05-14', '1557864437lri0t00e10ac', 1, 'thumb/15578644351107656IMG_20190514_WA0012.jpg', 0, 276, NULL),

During his NYSC days, Uche served with one of the biggest media firm, where he worked as the personal assistant to the boss, after his service, he was able to make the position permanent due to the good relationship he had with his boss.

And when he started putting out his own tweet and it was getting a lot of attention, he just fell in love with the app totally.</p><p>Aside work Uche has a social life too, he has two best friends, one he met on Twitter, <strong>Tunde, </strong>and his best friend from university days who recently moved to Lagos, <strong>Benson</strong>. Tunde is the one who actually taught Uche how to be a Digital Strategist, that was one thing that sealed their friendship finally though it has to be said that&nbsp;<i>na woman parol</i> first bring them together. Benson on the other hand, works 9-5 with a financial firm which doesnâ€™t give him that much free time compared to Uche and Tunde, he only links up with them mostly during the weekends compare to Uche and Tunde, who link up anytime they feel like, it\'s just to tweet at each other.</p>', 'uploads/15585866773642673Berger.jpg', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '04:44:39', '2019-05-23', '15585866790c00atei01lr', 1, 'thumb/15585866775598269Berger.jpg', 0, 152, NULL),

Some days before she was going to deliver the bag, the guy chatted her up but this time their conversation had nothing to do with the bag, the guy was trying to shoot his shot with her.

They met up at a mall in Ikeja, they did some chitchat before she brought out the bag to show him, he collected the bag from her, asked for her account number and transferred her balance into her account. After the business transaction was done, they started to get familiar with one another, just talking about random stuff but the guy wasnâ€™t really feeling the vibes because Felicia was there. He kind of made this known when he first saw the girl and they were greeting each other, after Bimbo had said, â€œâ€¦.<i>and this is my friend Felicia</i>â€, he smiled a little as he replied â€œ<i>I see, you brought your friend along</i>â€ but none of the girls read meaning into it, they didnâ€™t understand what he meant by that.</p><p>After thirty minutes of random talk and the guy still playing it cool that he was okay with Felicia being there with them, things begin to get weird.

After buying them something to eat and drink, he waited few more minutes after random talks had gone on, he then asked Felicia to excuse them, â€œâ€¦.<i>I will like to talk to Bimbo alone</i>,â€ he said. Felicia left the table but took the snack and drink that the guy bought, she took both snacks and her own drink leaving Bimboâ€™s drink.

It\'s a time for reality. Remember that you were told before the NYSC year that NYSC isn\'t a piece of cake you just pick up and you get filled up with all your expectations, neither is it a <i>gold-ridden,</i> <i>opportunity-filled</i> &nbsp;or <i>money-saving </i>adventure that it has been premeditated to be. You should also recall how much you had a <i>fantasia mirage</i> on how you would save all the money and engage other hustle to keep the hungry worms in your belly silent. You dreamt of how you would get job based on the fact that you are hardworking and a lobbyist, which would eventually get you retained. I hope you are not a lady and nobody slept with you before he finally told you what the Head Office said about retaining corpers and how they would not be able to squeeze you in at the moment. Even he did, <i>nothing spoil</i>.<i> </i>&nbsp;Now that you are done with NYSC. I hope you are now okay, especially if you couldn\'t get what you thought was promised. Good Morning, you just woke up.</p><p>I would share with you based on experience, the things you can do if you don\'t want to pile on the number of youths that are unemployed or underemployed or whatever name that status you don\'t like is called.</p><p><strong>Sit Down</strong></p><p>Think , think and think while you ask the question of \"<i>What do I want?</i>\" and \"<i>What can I do?</i>\". You will have to be sincere with the second question. You can\'t do everything and you don\'t want to make the mistake of going out there, looking for anything. That is the beginning of frustrated lifestyle, especially if you finally got the job that you don\'t like and after the first month you <i>cum</i> and your eyes that was all up would be all down. Then you would sit at your desk in the morning while you pray &nbsp;that 5pm should be like the twinkle of an eye, so that you rush home and rest a bit before you realize that it is 6am again and get furious. At best, it\'s Friday and you would be so so happy until the joy becomes short-lived and you rant about how the weekend was fast and Monday came running. Dear, weekends don\'t have legs, your job is all that scares you. Don\'t get the wrong one.</p><p><strong>Stay Focused</strong></p><p>Focus has its waiting time, but it is profitable thereof. Whatever you have considered as what you want, stay with it and make a decision to forge ahead no matter what, be it a job, business, skill learning or whatsoever. Sometimes you want to freak out because much money isn\'t coming as you wished, remember that it is <i>work</i> and not <i>blood money</i>, so it would take some time. Don\'t expect everything to go boom at once, as it is a gradual process. Concentrate on your work, make good decisions, clean up all obstacles. Don\'t be messed us by lot\'s of unproductive schedules nor should you get worked up by many <i>uncle\'s</i> promises. You can come ask me how much of waste of time that is. Most times it would move you from your plans and agendas till you finally waste lots of time on uncle\'s office or home visits and eventually find out later that they were only trying to get you busy and not that there is any plan for you. Though, sometimes it works for some guys. But those of use of which that lyrics apply , <i>\"if your papa no be Dangote or Adeleke\",</i> better double your hustle.</p><p><strong>You are a learner, so learn</strong></p><p>I know you believe that you are so smart. Yes I can give that you you, you are super smart. It is a good thing that you have such healthy self esteem, such a commendable mindset, the best that should be the case of any reasonable human being until you start to feel that you are the smartest of all there there is, there comes your huge problem. In this new era you got into, you would meet lot\'s of people that are smarter than you. Some are already doing the things you thought only you figured out. That particular thing that you thought makes you special, you would meet countless people that do it daily and you would wonder why it has not turned them around, cos you thought it is a <i>secrete formula</i>, the <i>top secrete pill</i> you found in that book that teaches \"<i>what guarantees success</i>\". But don\'t freak out, learn from others\' advice, be careful and learn to take what\'s profitable from an advice and ditch what\'s not. it\'s called \"<i>Eating the fish and throwing away the bone</i>\", and if it is all trash, be sure that it is not your Ego at work, then trash it.</p><p><strong>Adaptation</strong></p><p>We are quite aware that you have policies, principles or whatever it is that you have, it has been your bragging right all year long. But you see, it\'s time to review and edit. Don\'t be strict on irrelevant things just in the name of <i>\"That\'s me\", \"That\'s who I am\", \"I have principles\",\"That\'s how I do my things\". </i>You are in a new life era of life fella! Don\'t be a machine, don\'t be robotic, You are not a simulation, so be a real human being and change your tactics and principles when you learn more. Go out if you have to, relate with people when you have to, don\'t tell us about your temperament that doesn\'t allow you fit in the society, it\'s your weakness, so overcome it rather can educate us that it is who you are. As much as people would respect you for who you are, your myopic way of handling your principle would limit the number of people who would come to terms with recommending or working with you. They say things like, \"<i>He won\'t do it</i>\", \"<i>She like to do it</i>\", they finally make the decision for you, meanwhile you were drinking Garri since yesterday. What a shame! &nbsp;It\'s a thin line between principle and arrogance, be sure you are at the right side of this.</p><p><strong>That Job</strong></p><p>It is super important that we tell ourselves these things. We know that God would provide that job and God wants to bless you with a job, but would you please enrich yourself with adequate level of practical skills and competence to get a good one or any one at all? It is insufficient that you die at worship places , sleep on the alter, bath with coconut water as instructed by your<i> so called</i> prophet of the most high, just because you want to get a job and conquer that non-existing spirit and your step-mother that has no business meddling with your job provision. Do you even merit a job? If you are placed with others, do you naturally stand a chance? Rather than being an hypocrite at the church, deceiving yourself because you need something, especially when it is not as if you honor God for real, you don\'t go to worship His majesty, but to ask for what you have read that He promised, focus on standing a chance for a job by getting more professional skills. If you can\'t get a job on time or a good one, it is not the witches at work, it is a <i>National Disaster</i> in the country at the moment, as there are no sufficient good jobs out there to cater for every qualified people, not to talk of the unqualified bunch that struggle to get them. Don\'t waste much time, learn a skill, trade or anything \"<i>your hand findeth doing</i>\" and start making as much or as little as you can make. Some Lagos fellas that got the job even collect the salary and spend 80% of it on transport fare. Be Wise!</p><p><strong>No Job? There is Skill</strong></p><p>You can learn digital skills like Graphic Design, Animation Designs, Web Development, App Development, 3D Modelling, Embedded Systems(Engineers) and Etc. Be passionate about these skills, spend quality time on developing yourself and be hardworking.

Who says you can\'t try others such as Tailoring, Bag Making, Shoe Making, Catering even Barbing. You would be shocked that most of the guys on these skills make lots of money than some salary earners , especially the fresh graduates at the mercy of their employers. Some employers even treat employee as if they are doing them a favor.

(255, 'Why Eve?', 'Abdulhafeez Onitilo', 'show', '<p>It being a while I have written something controversial or thought provoking like many have called my write ups in the past, so here is a thought I have been holding back for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the reasons why I was holding back on this write up is because I couldnâ€™t find the perfect title to give it; the write up is basically centred on the Creation of Eve. Whether we choose to accept it or not, the creation of Eve changed the course of mankind, for me personally, I believe it was the actual beginning of mankind.</p><p>We know the story of the Forbidden Fruit so for those of you saying; here he goes again, blaming Eve for all the evil in the world blah blah blah. Sorry to disappoint you this write up as nothing to do with that, this is about the decision(s) that actually led to the creation of Eve and the role Eve had to play before eating the forbidden fruit.</p><p>For a while now I have been asking myself, why did God create Eve? According the scriptures, God created Eve because Adam was â€œlonelyâ€. Now let focus on the word â€œlonelyâ€, according to my dictionary, lonely means; feeling sad and unhappy about being socially isolated. It is also being sad because one has no friend or company to talk to.</p><p>Now letâ€™s go back to the statement that â€œGod created Eve because Adam was lonelyâ€. We can simply say that Adam was sad and unhappy because he didnâ€™t have anyone to talk to, and I will even be more specific to say that he didnâ€™t have any human like him that he could relate to, thatâ€™s why he felt lonely. If we look at it critically, he had the angels he could relate with, he had the animals he could talk to, God was even there for him, but there was no other â€˜beingâ€™ like him and that of course made him lonely. Now we should also recall that Adam never made his feelings about being lonely known to God, it was God who noticed and decided to do something about it.&nbsp;Now this is where I&nbsp; struggle, I have asked myself this question a lot and I will be asking you, hopefully we can come to a common answer. The question is; why Eve? Oh mine, I think I should just name the article that, Why Eve? Yes this is a perfect title; it captures everything on my mind perfectly.</p><p>Okay back to the question, why Eve? I mean if all Adam needed was a chat buddy, why didnâ€™t God create another male being, why did he have to create Eve; a female being. Obviously, Iâ€™m not saying creating a female being was a bad idea, just saying what exactly was the purpose of the female being? If all Adam needed was just someone to keep his company and play around in the Garden of Eden. In more than five different scriptures that I read that spoke about the creation of Eve, two words kept popping up; Alone and Helper.</p><p>In fact I never came across the word â€œLonelyâ€ in the entire scriptures I read, â€œAloneâ€ was the word being used to describe the state which Adam was. I donâ€™t think I need to start telling you the difference between â€œAloneâ€ and â€œLonelyâ€. Though I have to say I understand why we have come to replace the word Alone with Lonely, because according to the scriptures, God didnâ€™t create Eve immediately he noticed Adam was alone. God created Eve after noticing that amongst the creatures Adam had named he couldnâ€™t find any help (er) (Genesis 2, 18-25).</p><p>So to echo the answer many of you have been whispering, God created Eve as a helper to Adam. Now if am being correct, Adam didnâ€™t have any job he was tasked with in the Garden of Eden, maybe the naming of other things but that aside he didnâ€™t have any work to do, and this brings another question, what exactly did Adam need help with? &nbsp;Some scriptures pointed out that Adam needed a companion and if that is the case, it makes more sense to say women were created to help men with their loneliness and be their companion, unless of course you can tell me any other thing Adam needed help with that logically justify the creation of a female being.</p><p>This is why it was difficult to pick out a title for this article at first, if Iâ€™m saying God created Eve to help Adam with his feelings and emotions, it means that from the beginning God has been against homosexuality, which explains why He didnâ€™t create another man. Also we basically know that women where created for men, whether to be an helper or not, the bottom line is that, God created Eve for Adam and this also got me thinking, could this be the reason why men cheat? Because women were created for men, so a man will naturally run after them for \"help\", just saying. Another question bugging me is this, if Eve was created to help Adam, how come in the society that we live in today, we see women as the weaker being? Adam (the man) was the one who needed a helper and God gave him Eve (woman), so who is weaker?&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/15624219611781143Why_Eve.png', '1544793563df6a5lb09e3a74ze6hu5', '14:06:03', '2019-07-06', '156242196300tacr00lie1', 1, 'thumb/15624219613718793Why_Eve.png', 0, 656, NULL),

But while we pursue our well drafted goals, more things that looks like an opportunity may surface. It is important at this state to be able to discern if this is a distraction or an opportunity.&nbsp;<br>Take for instance, a young man once attempted to pursue a life long dream, to learn a &nbsp;skill that would cost him time and money, but the after-mart would be profitable. But while he was at the stage of starting to train, a job offer came, that would require all his time. This Job offer might be a distraction to this young man, depending on the after-mart of the skill he was going to learn, but at that moment, the job came looking like an opportunity to make money. To be able to figure out which one it is in between Opportunity or Distraction, one have to consider certain things:</p><p>1. We all need to ask questions of long time and short term effects of everything that comes to us.&nbsp;<br>2. We all have to look at futuristic tendencies of everything that comes to us.&nbsp;</p><p>3. We all have to ask about why we want to do anything or why we have to take an opportunity.</p><p>4.

(264, 'Money', 'Omotayo Mayowa', 'show', '<p>#<strong> MONEY</strong><br>.<br>I was so obsessed with the want of riches. The percentage of the want was very high. I can\'t continue to live like a church rat, a church rat is even far better, better than I do.<br>I can\'t wait to be like Chinedu, live large like Kayode, have lot of cars like Quadri, go to clubs and spend money like Kelvin. I\'m even older than Segun, see, he has everything he want. Abdul is a mate of my junior brother, yet, he still gives me \'five K\' to manage with all the money he has.&nbsp;<br>\"What do I do about this now? \'Cause right now, there\'s no way of survival without food. What do I even eat now?,&nbsp; \'cause am as broke as a lizard in the desserts, I might serve as dinner to a lucky python. Mtchw... Money... Food...\" I was lost to thought, and don\'t even know when Saliu arrived, he\'s here to drag with me again, drag the little thing I\'ll get to to my stomach with me. He\'s of no difference with me, I\'m better off him,\'cause he still beg from me: who has nothing, talk less of food to eat.<br>My only hope is Iya Alamala, if I can use my funnyman to talk convince her to give me just one wrap of Amala, that will be manageable for tonight.<br>\'Ogbeni! What have you been thinking!? \' Saliu half shouted at me, and I jolted out of my thoughts.&nbsp;<br>\'I\'ve been standing here for the past five years\', he exaggerated,<br>\'Any available food for me to bite?\', he inquired further, yawning like a hungry lion ready to devour. I casted an angry look at him, which gave him the signal of no to his query, and he strolled out.&nbsp; I picked my half-condemned \'baby Nokia\' phone, it\'s almost 4pm, and yet, no food for the worms. I could feel and hear the grumbles from my stomach, as the worms struggle for survival, they\'ve tried, since last night. I rolled back to a sleeping posture on my bed, and wandered back to my thoughts.<br>\"I think I need to visit Rasheed, I need quick solution... No, I\'ll meet Chinedu, (he used to be my best friend in the college before I dropped out, because of money), he\'ll have a better way to help,&nbsp; not to ask for money though, but to ask for solution. Hope I\'m not taking the wrong step?\" I was still wandering about my wonder land, when I drifted to sleep. Can\'t believe I slept on an empty stomach...&nbsp;<br>\'Alaye, longest time, how have you been na\' I greeted Chinedu on sitting on his sofa in his large sitting room.&nbsp;<br>\"Na television be this?\" I wondered as i stared at the very big flat screen television hanged on the wad as I shook my head amazingly.&nbsp;<br>\'So how far, na you I come see o\', I said as I turned back to Chinedu, who was handing me a glass of wine which I collected and dropped on the glassy table,&nbsp;<br>\'Uhmn uhmn?\' he inquired, it seems he has no interest in what I want to say, he thinks I want to beg for money again, but no, I want to have money like him, it\'s better I let the cat out of the bag, \'cause I can\'t die like this,<br>\'Chinedu, I want get money!\' I bursted out like a cow filled to the brim waiting to burst. He spitted the wine he had sipped back to the glass, \"is it what I said that made him choke or what?\" I wondered,<br>\'You say wetin? You wan get money?\' he inquired irritatingly,&nbsp;<br>\'Yes na,&nbsp; abi na bad thing?\' I retorted,<br>\'No na, but how e take concern me?\' he asked annoyingly as he rolled his eyes, \"Imagine, na me Chinedu they talk to like this, because of money wey I no get, person wey me dey help solve Maths and Physics questions for school, well, na conditions make crayfish bend, no p\", I cried in my thoughts as I glanced through my memories with Chinedu back in the college, all our wishes, our plans and how we planned to do everything together, well, a sick hen that still lives has hope of swallowing even if its a grain of maize. Any how he talks to me is isn\'t my concern, I just needed the help and get away. Let me just hit the nail on the head,&nbsp;<br>\'Wetin concern you be say, I need your help, I want make you show me the way, abeg\', I said&nbsp; begged, he roared with laughter for a while,&nbsp;<br>\'You are so funny, you haven\'t changed up till now\', he said, is he thinking that I\'m here to joke,<br>\'Alaye, am damn serious o\', I said with all seriousness, he calmed down seeing my degree of seriousness,&nbsp;<br>\'So, go and find work now!\' he spat out, the words hit me like a trailer whose brakes has failed, thank God I didn\'t die as a result,&nbsp;<br>\'But, Chinedu, you know me now, I no finish school, with which certificate I go take find work, abi you go give me your own?\' I pitifully let out,&nbsp;<br>\'You deh mad? Why I go give you my own? I no even know where e deh sef, because no be him I take get money, he let out angrily, \'so wetin you want make I do now?\' he asked further as he dropped his glass of wine, seems he\'s ready,&nbsp;<br>\'Chinedu, you suppose understand, how you take get your money, put me for that same way, am ready to do anything, anything at all\', I said with determination, a determination without determination. But am I sure I mean what I said? Am I truly ready to do anything?&nbsp;<br>\'Okay I go carry you go somewhere...\'&nbsp;<br>We were in a room, painted or I should rather say clothed with white, black and red arrays, I could see a calabash, an idol, a horn and many other fetish stuffs, there was Baba who was sitting on wooden stool, only tying a white wrapper on his waist, a black hair band in his head, oh! he actually had dreadlocks, they were gray, he\'s actually an old man, he used to whitish substance to make tattoos on his left breast, and a circle on his right eye and some other parts of his body. I need no one to tell me we are in for it. He understands what I wanted. He introduced himself as a regular customer to the Baba, the Baba nodded in affirmation to his explanation of recognition, he introduced me too and the Baba motioned him to stop as he wanted to proceed in the exposition of my reason of coming.&nbsp;<br>\"But was this actually what I wanted, was this how I wanted to become rich, but there seem to be no way other than this\" , I was lost in thoughts, I wasn\'t even concentrating. Chinedu slapped my head back to reality, he dragged and submitted my right palm to the Baba, he collected and held it in his hand, his eyes were to my palm, like the eyes of a lady glued to the Zee world movie series, perhaps he\'s looking at something spectacular, he\'s looking at my destiny, I knew it won\'t be more than that, as I have seen in Nollywood. All of a sudden he shouted, I knew he must, he have seen something, I thought he would shout \'Abomination!\' afterwards, (that\'s how they do it in Nollywood), but he didn\'t, he said some incantations into my palm for a long time and then closed it, then pushed it forward, letting it rest on my forehead. Afterwards, he gave me a calabash filled with a kinda liquor which I can\'t fathom what it was, I irritatingly sipped from it, it was sour, I could feel its impact all over my body and even down to my spine and bone marrow. He let out a soft laugh after I handed his calabash to him,&nbsp;<br>\'Your destiny is great\', he let out after a while, \'but due to poverty, you\'ve eaten your destiny with food and passed it out as an ordure\' he lamented,&nbsp;<br>\'Chai, Chinedu, ayaff die\', I cried out, \'but wait o, what is or...ordu....ordure?\' I asked no one in particular, not sure of&nbsp; what I was asking,&nbsp;<br>\'It means shit, faeces\', the Baba answered,&nbsp;<br>\"Ha! The Baba is even blowing grammar, on top of my matter,\" I thought as I cried,&nbsp;<br>\'But there is solution\', the Baba said, I immediately wiped my tears and concentrated,&nbsp;<br>\'We\'ll need to make a sacrifice to appease the gods to release your destiny back, then do the ritual of riches properly\', I listened with rapt attention,&nbsp;<br>\'I\'ll do the sacrifice my self, so don\'t bother\', he added,&nbsp;<br>\'Thank God\', I commented,&nbsp;<br>\'And the ritual, you\'ll get some materials which are a bit difficult to get...\', \'which are?\' I inquiringly interrupted,&nbsp;<br>\'Kai! chill now!\', Chinedu cautioned. The Baba just smiled as he opened and deeped his right hand into a calabash arrayed with white cowries and with an inscription \'AJE\', he brought out a white paper and handed it to me,&nbsp;<br>\'Go get the materials listed there\', he said referring to the paper. I was happy we were getting close to the solution. I was about to open the paper, but the Baba made a signal to me not to, I gently kept the paper in my pocket, he motioned me to listen to him,&nbsp;<br>\'At this stage, no backing out!\' he let out,&nbsp;<br>\"When am not in the military\" I thought, I was terrified, I know am in for it, but there seem to be no way apart from this one I\'ve tread, and now no going back,<br>\'Go get the things quickly, the deadline is only two days, I\'ve warned you, no backing out, you\'ve made a covenant with the \'Ifa\' , and you will have all you want if you you do what is required of you, failure to do so, the repercussions will&nbsp; be unbearable\', he said on a final note. No one need to tell me that if I didn\'t bring the requests in two days, I\'m in hot soup. I signal a lets go to Chinedu, but he waved me to wait for him outside, it took him a while to come out, as I was already tired of waiting.&nbsp;<br>On our way back, I brought out the list, Gosh! I was terrified, \'Stop!\' I screamed at Chinedu, he immediately stepped on the brake pad,&nbsp;<br>\'Where does he expect me to get all this things?\' I lamented bitterly, Chinedu collected the list from me, he glanced through and look at me in awe,&nbsp;<br>\'So, what is it that you can\'t get here?, the six months old virgin chicken, or the kidney of two anopheles mosquitoes, or which of them, shebi na you want get money, you better get sense and do fast, I\'ve done my part,\' he queried angrily,&nbsp;<br>\'Don\'t you see the last requirement?\' I asked rhetorically, he glanced and made a grin,&nbsp;<br>\'Oh, that\'s easy we\'ll go to a hospital...&nbsp;<br>\'Ogbeni, look sharp, put am inside the bag make we cut out... I go leave you run o... the nurse deh com... make we deh go jhor\' Chinedu was just ranting. I finished packing and ready to leave, Chinedu held the door knob, and pulled, to our utter dismay, a nurse was standing at the door, probably waiting for us to come out, we made to move but we were attacked by three security men, before we could say jack, the doctors appeared from no where as if they\'ve been hiding around. This is a bad luck!&nbsp;<br>\'How do you reach here?\' one if the doctors threw at us,&nbsp;<br>\'And what\'s in the bag you\'re holding?\' another one threw, I opened my mouth, but no word came out,&nbsp;<br>\'Answer now before I smash your head!\' a security man shouted as he charged towards me,<br>\'Search the bag\', the doctor who seemed to be the senior ordered. And one security man moved close to me, I held tight unto the bag, though I was visibly shaking, he made to collect the bag, but I dragged it back, I looked at Chinedu and he gave me a go ahead signal, as he was ready to move, all attention was on me, so he had a chance to sneak, on sneaking out of the scene, he charged forward, I threw the bag at him and he caught it, all attention shifted to Chinedu as they begin to chase him, I escaped without wasting a second, unluckily, I was grabbed by my collar by God-knows-who, but fortunately, I successfully pulled off the shirt for him without looking back. I always knew I had a talent called \'running\' I discovered it that day, if I were to compete with Hussain Bolt at that moment, no doubt I will defeat him, I ran to the extent that I could feel my heels on my occiput. Thank God I escaped, but I can\'t find my accomplice, I explored all the nook and cranny of my refuge, but I can\'t find my confederate. I stealthily find my way back to Baba\'s places, but Chinedu isn\'t there, I lost my baby Nokia phone on the process of my escape and I can\'t contact anybody, he ought to have reported back to Baba\'s place if he had successfully escaped, because we have less than five hours to complete the rituals, it\'s obvious Chinedu has been caught.&nbsp;<br>\'Abomination!\' Baba shouted as I narrated the ordeal to him, I know there is problem, \'There\'s problem\' he spatt,&nbsp;<br>\'If the one day old baby\'s head and heart are not produced before the dead line, yours shall be used to in place&nbsp; baby\'s, because no one promise the \'Irunmoles\' and go free without fulfillment\' Baba said, I was terrified, I was already urinating on my body,&nbsp;<br>\'Enough!, You cannot urinate in front of Irunmole!\' Baba exclaimed, I had to hold on to my urine and store them back to my bladder, \'so, Baba... wha...t is...is the...the solu..lu...tion now,\'? I asked shuttering,&nbsp;<br>\'The solution is what I\'ve told you, you will replace the baby\', I began to weep uncontrollably, I beckon on the gods of my ancestral fathers, but all of them seem to be deaf at the moment, even Sango wasn\'t answering me.&nbsp;<br>Time was rolling by, but no hope of deliverance, not even from Ogun. My tears has blurred my vision but my cerebrum cerebellum can process what I\'m seeing at that moment, I saw Baba brought out a pot, a pot boiling fiercely on it\'s own, without fire, I could hear the sound, it\'s boiling point perhaps could not be measured by a thermometer, the heat generated from this pot filled the room, as I was sweating profusely, but surprisingly, Baba held the pot with his bare hands, he dropped it at the center of the room, on the white-clothed floor, he said somethings that my cerebrum cerebellum processed to be tongues I haven\'t heard before, for like thirty minutes, he was still blasting and moving round in a circulatory motion like being powered by a centripetal force (I\'m shocked, my brain could still remember some terms in physics at that moment). Suddenly, I can\'t even move a finger talk less of my whole body, I stopped crying, I can\'t even see clearly again, I\'m not my normal self, but I\'m still who I am: the broke ass nigga looking for wealth, no changes.&nbsp;<br>He suddenly stopped, he motioned me to come forward, and like an automated machine, I moved closer, and like a computer system affected by virus, without given any instructions, I kneeled facing inside the pot, i was sweating an ocean as a result of the heat from the un-fired boiling pot. Like a lamb, lamb meant for sacrifice, lead to the slaughter, to be killed, killed without its consent, that\'s what I am.<br>Baba lifted his cutlass, glittering like a just refined silver, ready to cut asunder, I could see the reflection of the action from the boiling pot (but my brain processed it to be a film), the cutlass was going down bit by bit, down to my neck:&nbsp; that was<br>as&nbsp; long as that of a starved giraffe, the cutlass was six micrometers away from my neck, (but my brain brought the output to be two meters), just then the door blasted open, some people in a cloth of color which it took five minutes to be processed by my brain; black, holding some instruments looking like sticks, know as rifle came in with somebody who has stains of red or pink, or maybe green (can\'t actually be processed at that moment) on his cloth,&nbsp;<br>\'That\'s him, my accomplice\' he said pointing to someone I think is standing behind me, the people in black started exchanging words with another man, who looked like a masquerade holing a machete, and there were demonstrations of powers like I used to see in Nollywood. I turned around and sat down to watch d beautiful scene. All of a sudden I could see Chinedu (Finally i regained my senses), he has stains of blood all over him, it dawned on me he has been caught, he lost the baby, oh!, How can he be so careless, and he know it\'s thats the solution, I remembered those in blacks to be Nigerian police officers, I sighted a police officer saying some incantations into his gun, before I could say jack, Baba was lying dead on the floor as a result of a bullet released from the police officers\' rifle, I could feel death ruminating round my head, I need to find an escape route, I need to survive, the police officers were still ruminating round about the room, without thinking twice, I sneaked, it\'s not easy but I tried, and I succeed, in reaching outside, I took to my heels, not long, I began to hear the siren, I\'ve got no strength remain in me to run, but I just knew am running. I was still running, but not running like I was running, I was now seeing thing in five dimensions, black and white and colorless. I was still running, and I ran into a tree with my hands opened for a hug, (actually my brain processed it to be a lady), and boom!...</p><p>I repelled upward from my bed like a repellent force between like charges in an electric field, feeling weak, hungry and tired.<br>It was just a dream!&nbsp;<br>What a dream, thank God it\'s just a dream, I could feel the sweat, urine and tears, it came out real. \'Chai! Which kind dream be this?\', I asked myself rhetorically loud .&nbsp;<br>\'Ha! Thank God, it was just a dream\'&nbsp;<br>\'I\'m no longer interested in&nbsp; becoming rich again, let me remain like this, as far as there is life, there\'s still hope, it\'s better like this, than losing my life because of wealth...\' I was still in my thoughts and cleaning up when someone knocked on my door,<br>\'Who is that o?\' I asked irritatingly,&nbsp;<br>\'Boda Mayowa, its me o, Iya Alamala, you go buy Amala today?\', she asked,&nbsp;<br>\'Yes o, give me four wraps\', I replied as I stood up to meet her outside with a wide grin on my face, its dark already, thank God food has come, incase you don\'t know, I like food,&nbsp;<br>\'But I don\'t have money on me now o, later if you are coming back, stop by, and I\'ll give you your money, plus yesterday own, three wraps, making it two fifty\', I said convincingly with joy in my heart,&nbsp;<br>\'Yes no problem, thank you\' she said as she handed my Amala to me. \'She\'s still telling me thank you, on my debts\', I thought as I walked back to my room.&nbsp;<br>After i finished my clean up, I devoured the four wraps with a constant speed of forty kilometers per hour, without retarding.&nbsp;<br>Thank God, I didn\'t do money ritual, and I won\'t.&nbsp;<br>\'Ha! Egbon Mayor, thank God it was just a dream o\' Joseph, the boy who had been listening to me commented,&nbsp;<br>\'Yeah, thank God\' I replied,&nbsp;<br>\'Had it&nbsp; been it was real, you for don kpeme..\'&nbsp;<br>\'Na u go kpeme\' I replied as I hit him playfully, and we laughed out, we paused for a while, looked at each other and rolled into another round of unending laughter.&nbsp;<br>.&nbsp;<br>THE END</p><p>#<strong> Morals:</strong><br>No matter the situation, no matter how poor, as far as you can still feed yourself, wear good cloths, pay rent, Blood money is not an option.&nbsp;<br>To hustle is good, but not the type of the hustle&nbsp; I did in my dreams.&nbsp;<br>This story led to a fore hand write up of mine titled \"Fullness Of Time\", if it isn\'t your time, nothing will happen....

Definitely a greedy man will be selfish and desires various things for himself. Thereby when offered to engage in an evil act will not hesitate in partaking in such, there by,having a corrupt mind about some certain &nbsp;things and becoming a bad image of the country he belongs to. &nbsp;</p><p>Wole Soyinka once said and I quote \"when you are looking for corruption, you should look at the entire stratum &nbsp;of the society, while some forms of corruption are direct,others are indirect\". He further side \" To achieve any change in the minds of the youth,there must be re-orientation in terms of materialistic tendencies, corruption and crime generally\". Joe Biden said \"fighting corruption is not just good governance. It is self defense. It\'s patriotism \". We can abstain from being a corrupt majority by being creative. By taking an anti corruption drive on stage and as well give ideas about how to improve your own community. Raise awareness about it\'s adverse effects on society.&nbsp;</p><p>Make your integrity known and prove you are one of the minority that can make a good turn. &nbsp;Get involved!

Quite shocking! OAU has for a long time been a shining pointer for other universities to follow interms ofacademic discipline and culture and it is quite disheartening for such scandal to emanate from the great citadel of learning. Pof. Akindele Richard who is also a everend is a professor from the department of a accounting, obafemi awolowo university. He was the culprit in the sex for mark scandal where he was caught asking a young lady named Monica Ogah for sex not just once but 5 times so he could upgrade her because she failed his course. The victim, Monica is a postgraduate student of the same department. It was revealed that Monica actually scored 45 in the prof\'s course but the prof. failed her so he could have his way before he could upgrade her score. In a bid to expose the evil intent, Monica called the Prof. and secretly recorded their conversation while pretending to succumb to his offer. On 9th of April, the scandal was exposed when Monica released the audio recording of their conversation on various social media platforms. The recording clearly had the voice of Prof. and she also mentioned his name for clear-cut evidence. When the issue finally exploded and went extremely viral, the management of OAU had to set up a committee to investigate the scandal. The VC said that the university management won\'t condone any form of lecturer-student sexual harrasment and a high powered imvestigation committee has been setup to probe the allegation in one week. He vowed that anyone found guilty and culpable won\'t go unpunished. &nbsp;He further asserted that the school has and would always maintain its zero tolerance for sexual harassment. However, some of the church members and a reverend in the professor\'s church told the media that they had listened to the recording and verified that it is indeed profs voice. &nbsp;However they were of the opinion that it was a setup. One of his church member had this to say: \"The voice in the leaked audio is clearly that of reverend akindele Richard. But the man is too gentle for such act. the lady set him up purposely\". The professor\'s wife was also visited and she blamed the devil for her husband predicaments. &nbsp;Speaking to the victim, Here\'s what she said. \" Before the matter went viral, the university was aware of it and they did not do anything about it. If the case did not go viral, the university would have probably swept the issue under the carpet. I think we should focus more on whether the act of the professor amounts to sexual harassment, whether it was a breach of the school\'s code of conduct whether it was a breach of the terms of contract for lecturers or whether he abused the relationship that ought to exist between students and lecturers.\" She also mentioned that she didn\'t release the audio. She gave the recording to two persons when she was seeking for help and one of them decided to release the audio.</p>', 'uploads/9503402IMG_20180506_165540_327.jpg', 'admin7851792597', '16:12:49', '2018-05-06', '2wo42s984n96eu4a0', 'thumb/128840thumb1535204766.jpg'),

The rector gave the warning on Sunday while unveiling a billboard on decent dressing code donated by Higher National Diploma (HND) students of Mass Communication Department of the school. â€œNo student must offer bribe or sex to any lecturer in order to obtain better grades in their academics. â€œStudents also have the right to report to the school authority any attempt by any lecturers to collect bribe from them or subject them to any sexual harassment, â€œhe said. Gamau also warned the students to desist from indecent dressing and other unruly behaviours capable of attracting sanctions from the school management. The rector, however, commended the students for the gesture and urged them to be obedient and loyal to their lecturers. He said that that the school was always awarding its certificates to its graduating students having found them worthy in learning and character. He also advised them to ensure that the relationship between lecturers and students in the institution were like that of the parents and their children. Mr Abubakar Umar, the leader of the students group that donated the billboard said that the gesture was a way of contributing their quota to enlighten their fellow students on decency on campus. â€œMass Communications students are potential journalists and their duties are to enlighten and inform members of the society. â€œThat is why we deemed it necessary to help the school authority in drawing the attention of our fellow students to shun nudity in the polytechnic in order to avoid penalties, â€œhe said.&nbsp;</p><p>NAN</p><p>Source: <a href=\" https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/rector-warns-students-sex-mark/\">Vanguard</a>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/5502721Dchv67NWAAA8VhA.jpg', 'admin7115698293', '16:45:24', '2018-05-06', '7o2e3t670c4w3r6nser8', 'thumb/6796820thumb1535204757.jpg'),

Jointly signed by Messrs. Oloniniran Gbenga and Oyedeji S.I, Chairman and Secretary respectively, the letter stated that the misconduct of the university administration, headed by Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede, has resulted in the disruption of academic activities and deteriorating welfare conditions on campus.</p><p>According to the studentsâ€™ body, the university secretariat has been sealed by the Osun State Internal Revenue Service (OSIRS) since 2 May over a tax debt of N1.8 billion. The studentsâ€™ body recalled that the university was dragged to court by the OSIRS over the tax debt, which dates back to 2015.</p><p>This, it said, was later resolved after the allowances were separated from taxes, leaving the tax debt at N500million. The university, according to the studentsâ€™ body, agreed to liquidate the liability&nbsp;within one year&nbsp;in a Memorandum of Understanding it signed during the Vice Chancellorship of Professor Bamitale Omole.</p><p>It noted, however, that the agreement has been breached, the result of which is the sealing off of the universityâ€™s Senate Building.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of the shutdown, administrative functions in the university have been paralyzed. â€œMany of the non-academic staff and security operatives working at the Senate Building have no access to their offices.</p><p>â€œThey now resume outside, where they stay under the sun.</p><p>â€œThis development threatens to disrupt the universityâ€™s academic calendar.</p><p>â€œCurrently, the non-academic staff are on the verge of suspending activities pending the resolution of the crises between the university and the state government.</p><p>â€œThis action will further affect academic activities,â€ the students said.</p><p>The students alleged that taxes have always been deducted from salaries of university staff, but never remitted. They equally alleged that the university management has failed to&nbsp;account for over N17.5 million paid for identity cards by over 35,000 students for the 2016/2017 academic session.</p><p>â€œThe university administration failed to issue identity cards to students.</p><p>â€œThis exposed many students to assault and harassment from policemen, which has resulted in the detention of many students by the Police over an inability to properly identify themselves as students of the university.</p><p>â€œMany students have also missed scholarship and job opportunities for this reason,â€ claimed the students.&nbsp;</p><p>They similarly claimed that over N14million is paid every session as development levy by fresh students, with each paying N18,000. But the payment of this fee, said the student, does not reflect on the learning and welfare conditions on campus.</p><p>â€œThe laboratories have been ill-equipped for years; the library and lecture theatres dilapidated and outdated; deteriorating hostel and health facilities.</p><p>â€œThese are the obtainable conditions of Obafemi Awolowo University.</p><p>â€œTill now, the postgraduate students pay N7,000 as health centre due upon admission, yet they are required to pay N5000 as registration fee to use the health centre, something the university management has failed to explain why it is charged,â€ they said.</p><p>In addition, the students alleged that funds paid to the university yearly from the Federal Governmentâ€™s Tertiary Health Insurance Scheme, the university still charges each students N1, 800 as health fee, which amounts to N63 million per session.</p><p>The university, they added, is currently constructing a new Senate Building with funds from World Bank disbursed through Central Bank of Nigeria.</p><p>â€œThese funds were meant to be used for construction of students\' hostels and provision of academic facilities. With the former senate building having vast unoccupied office spaces, the university has diverted funds to build a new senate building while students live like prisoners in the wretched hostels.</p><p>â€œAbout N60 million has been expended on this new project, but the structure has barely gone beyond the foundation and almost abandoned,â€ claimed the studentsâ€™ body.</p><p>Another allegation brought against the university authorities is that they chase students away from on campus hostels, forcing them to seek accommodation in off-campus hostels built by the university officials.</p><p>The students lamented that their efforts to challenge the corruption in the university system have been met with iron hand. The Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede-led university administration, they alleged, breached the rights of students to independent unionism, freedom of expression and association by suspending student activists, causing them to be arrested and detained in prison custody.</p><p>â€œAs a union, we call on the EFCC, ICPC, FIRS and other relevant government agencies to swing into action and immediately probe the administration of Obafemi Awolowo University over the aforementioned mismanagement of public funds and corrupt dealings.</p><p>â€œThe university must make the institution\'s account public for all to see, being a public property.</p><p>â€œWe urge the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to extend its anti-corruption campaign to Obafemi Awolowo University, where the President is a visitor,â€ said the students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://saharareporters.com\">Sahara Reporters New York</a></p>', 'uploads/9037552images_(2).jpeg', 'admin7115698293', '17:20:05', '2018-05-09', '9uo0908s4506n7aew', 'thumb/1468145thumb1535204724.jpg');
